[Bootcamp > Week 1 > Day 2](https://whitehatlearningproducts.github.io/swe/bootcamp/wk1/day2.html)

## Overview of the day

Today we are doing to learn about test driven development. We are going to use this philosophy of test driven development (TDD) to begin creating JavaScript objects and use them to program in an object orientated style. 

# Lesson 1 - Your first failing test

## Learning Objectives

* Write a unit test
* Describe the purpose of a unit test
* Implement the TDD cycle of red, green, refactor

## Pre-work or Assumed knowledge

* family tree assignment

## Materials

* code editor

## Notes

This introduces TDD. Use this session to support apprentices in getting Jest set up and running. Apprentices will be organising their code using `module.exports` and `require`. In our next session they can practice setting this up again themselves. You might want to expand on more of the [Jest expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect) API. Those who need stretch objectives should try to use a few different expects i.e. objectContaining, not.objectContaining, toHaveProperty

## Assignment

They can practice the family tree again.
