# Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 2

## Overview of the day

Your group project will be to create a 'Task List' application similar to this (note you are free to design the UI however you like!):

![to do list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/106533527-42286300-64ea-11eb-9cb3-049171f4b772.PNG) 

You may therefore want to use `drag and drop` to move tasks from one list (e.g. To Do) to another (e.g. In Progress) hence today we will discover how to implement this using JavaScript.
