# Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 1

## Overview of the day
Today we turn our attention to the Browser. We look firstly at Web Accessibility, a critical part of website development, ensuring that people with disabilities can use the web equally.

We then discuss the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), HTML DOM Events and how to write JavaScript in the browser.

Modern web applications are powered by JavaScript. There are lots of popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue that help to organise and support building applications in a browser. We focus on a micro-framework called AppRun which mimics the design of React, Elm and to some degree Vue and Angular.
