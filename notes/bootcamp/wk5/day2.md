# Bootcamp > Week 5 > Day 2 (Coach Notes)

## Overview of the day

Final day of group projects time. Introduce Heroku.

## Deploy with Heroku

Take one of the group projects or fork it and make the adjustments to deploy the app to Heroku. If you are feeling fresh you can explain a little about Heroku's ephemeral file system, or "paas" (platform as a service), or show them the Github CD integration. If a group is not ready to deploy to Heroku, get them to at least make a release on Github. They can just use the GUI, but make a release so they can come back and run a demo on Friday.
