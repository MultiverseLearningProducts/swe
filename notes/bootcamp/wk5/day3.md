# Bootcamp > Week 5 > Day 3 (Coach Notes)

## Overview of the day

Individual feature project day 1 of 2.

## My Feature

Apprentices should fork the original project if it is not their Github repo. Make sure there is a release on the original repo. These 2 days are a chance to implement your own code. To design and deliver a feature that you are interested in.

Emphasis the return to the design phase. Features might include:

* Introduce WebSockets for some realtime task updates
* Extend the data modal with task comments, or due dates
* Redesign, make more responsive
* Introduce task prioritization with drag and drop
* Extend End to End tests for your group app

Whatever they want to do.
