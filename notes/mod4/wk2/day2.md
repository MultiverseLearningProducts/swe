This module has been about getting you ready for your synoptic EPA project. You've completed the project. Now you need to demo it! Today we will coveer ways to record your demo, talking points to cover, and where to upload. 

### How to demo your app 
[back](#Overview)

#### 10 minutes 
As part of your EPA project you need to create a demo to be reviewed by the EPAO. Demos are a great way to give an overview of your project, focusing on the important parts, and calling out features or key areas. When we think of demos, we don't want a long narration that shows only one thing. We want to see at the start what your application does, then you want to break down key features you know your audiance will want to hear. For the EPAO it is completeing the project but also narrating WHY you did something. Why pick a stack over another? Or a database design? What is the justification? Some of these things can be answered very quickly, some you may need to ellaborate on. That is okay! 

It can be daunting to record yourself and start narrating. Practice a few times without recording. You can also make a script to follow to make sure you cover the key points. Whatever works for you!

For this part of the session go to a few websites and demo how someone would record. You can take a poll to see what OS apprentices use most and show the mos tpopular versions. Key to highlight here is the apprentices need to upload their video to a platform so they can share the link out.
