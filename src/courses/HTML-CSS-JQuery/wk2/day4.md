* Use 7 techniques to answer multiple choice questions

## Lesson

**1. Read the entire question**
_Read a multi-choice question in its entirety before glancing over the answer options. Students often think they know what a question is asking before reading it and jump straight to the most logical answer. This is a big mistake and can cost you dearly on multiple-choice exams. Read each question thoroughly before reviewing answer options._

**2. Answer it in your mind first**
_After reading a question, answer it in your mind before reviewing the answer options. This will help prevent you from talking yourself out of the correct answer._

**3. Eliminate wrong answers**
_Eliminate answer options which you’re 100 percent sure are incorrect before selecting the answer you believe is correct. Even when you believe you know the right answer, first eliminating those answers you know are incorrect will ensure your answer choice is the correct choice._

**4. Select the best answer**
_It’s important to select the best answer to the question being asked, not just an answer the seems correct. Often many answers will seem correct, but there is typically a best answer to the question that your professors is looking for._

**5. Read every answer option**
_Read every answer option prior to choosing a final answer. This may seem like a no brainer to some, but it is a common mistake students make. As we pointed out in the previous section, there is usually a best answer to every multiple-choice question. If you quickly assume you know the correct answer, without. first reading every answer option, you may end up not selecting the best answer._

**6. Answer the questions you know first**
_If you’re having difficulty answering a question, move on and come back to tackle it once you’ve answered all the questions you know. Sometimes answer easier question first can offer you insight into answering more challenging questions._

**7. Pay attention to these words**
_Pay particularly close attention to the words; not, sometimes, always, and never. An answer that includes always must be irrefutable. If you can find a single counterexample, then the answer is not correct. The same holds true for the word never. If an answer option includes never a single counterexample will indicate the answer is not the correct._
