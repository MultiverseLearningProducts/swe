# Mod 2 > Week 1 > Day 1

Coaches: structure for module, including code samples, etc: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yEXM0tg1xQJzzhAWPbw4rYeg3bF2ixs57pAh2_kE4q4/edit?usp=sharing).

In the fullness of time, the stucture above needs to be turned into a JavaScript course we can enroll students on.

Mock exams can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s__-ZrkKz3oLw9P26aUe787wCritSIQE?usp=sharing).

Some notes:

- Some apprentices found the validation practical on day 1 a challenge. Consider moving to later in the week
- The apprentices really enjoyed the bug fixing exercise on day 2
- Consider bringing DOM content earlier in the week (apprentice feedback)
- They seemed to enjoy sketching the DOM
- The GET vs POST must cover things like caching, max query param length, when to use GET/POST
- Offloading the best practice research to the apprenties in groups seemed to work well
- Apprentices reported that our mock questions are "very relevant" to the actual exam
- They really enjoyed doing the Spotify clone app (ask Dan for more info)
- Revision time with ad-hoc mock exams seemed to work well in week 2
