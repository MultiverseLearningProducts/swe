# Mod 2 > Week 1 > Day 3

# Overview of the day

Today we're going to start with a little test, then we'll go on to look at sorting and searching arrays.

# Lesson 1

## Learning Objectives

- Complete the FizzBuzz challenge

## Assignment - FizzBuzz

We now have enough knowledge under our belts to attempt a typical JavaScript interview question known as FizzBuzz.

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print "Buzz"
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

The first ten numbers, for example, would look like this:

```
1
2
"Fizz"
4
"Buzz"
"Fizz"
7
8
"Fizz"
```
