# Mod 2 > Week 2 > Day 3

# Overview of the day

Today we look at bug fixing and debugging strategies.

# Lesson 1

## Learning Objectives

- Understand common debugging strategies
- Leverage Chrome Dev Tools to debug

# Common debugging strategies

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in your programs. All programs (even ones that are live and deployed!) have bugs. Even operating systems will have bugs that the developers will "patch". A patch is fix for a problem in a computer program.

> Did you know? The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics

## Console logging

We've already used one of the primary strategies to debug and that is the `console.log` statement. Use this often in the development process to test the output of programs, but do consider removing these statements when your apps go live!

## The debugger statement

The `debugger` keyword can be used anywhere in your applications to launch the debugging tool in the environment you're in.
