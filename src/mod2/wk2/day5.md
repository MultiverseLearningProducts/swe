## Retake policy

Here's Microsoft's retake policy:

- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score on an exam the first time, the candidate must wait 24 hours before retaking the exam. At that time, candidates can log onto their certification dashboard and reschedule the exam themselves.

- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score the second time, the candidate must wait at least 14 days before retaking the exam a third time.

- A 14-day waiting period is also imposed between the third and fourth attempts and fourth and fifth attempts.

A candidate may not take a given exam any more than five times per year (12 months). This 12-month period starts from the first attempt. The candidate is eligible to retake the exam 12 months from the date of their first attempt.
