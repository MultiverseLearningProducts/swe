The aim of this session is to integrate our classes with a persistent layer. So the state in our app will last from one running instance to the next. You know how to create a class. When we create a new instance of a Restaurant we also want to create a new entry in our database. When we create a new Menu we will also want to create that menu in the database, and associate it with the right restaurant, and have a instance of a menu in the menus array in our restaurant.
