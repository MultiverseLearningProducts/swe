# Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 4

## Overview of the day

Today you should be motoring on your project.

----

## Lesson 1 - Peer reviews

## Learning Objectives

* Recall the key parts of a peer review

## Before we start

* N/A

## Materials needed

* Github

## Lesson

You will learn what makes a good pull request by reviewing them. Your job when reviewing code is quality control.

* Is the code doing what the card asked for?
* Is it free from faults and errors with tests to prove that it is?
* Can you checkout the branch and run it? (try it in Chrome, Firefox and Safari)
* Is it small and only touching files that need to be touched?
* Is it easy to read and follow?

You can push back. Massive refactors are not cool. Confusing code is also not cool. Be kind, make suggestions, you can even pair to solve something together.

## Assignment

* Practice making pull requests
* Practice reviewing code
