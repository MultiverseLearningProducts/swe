# Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 1

## Overview of the day

Today we turn our attention to the Browser. We look firstly at Web Accessibility, a critical part of website development, ensuring that people with disabilities can use the web equally. 

We then discuss the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), HTML DOM Events and how to write JavaScript in the browser.

Modern web applications are powered by JavaScript. There are lots of popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue that help to organise and support building applications in a browser. We focus on a micro-framework called [AppRun](https://apprun.js.org/) which mimics the design of React, Elm and to some degree Vue and Angular.

## Lesson 1 - Web Accessibility
The Web is an essential part of every day life. Web Accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web equally. At least 1 in 5 people in the UK have a long term illness, impairment or disability; many more have a temporary disability.

The [standards for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are governed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are internationally recognised.

The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html) defines access to content on the Web as a basic human right. The UK [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. Public Sector websites are required by law to meet accessibility standards.

Listen to this video introduction to Web Accessibility from the [W3C Web Accesssibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/) to understand why Web Accessibility is so important. Enable Closed Captions using the CC option in You Tube if you require it.

The WCAG is built around four principle guidelines;
  1. **Perceivable** - information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
  2. **Operable** - users must be able to navigate the content
  3. **Understanding** - content should be presented in clear and simple language
  4. **Robust** - content must be able to be interpreted by a variety of different assistive technologies

Web Accessibility is essential for many but useful for everyone.

## Assignment
  1. Use the `Lighthouse` tool in Chrome Developer Tools to generate a Web Accessibility report for all the pages in your restaurant application.
     * Add your "before" report to a new folder `/accessibility` in the GitHub repo which has your restaurant code
     * How many issues does Lighthouse find?
     * Why could these issues cause issues for users with disabilities?
     * Now edit your HTML to fix these issues
     * Add your "after" report to the `/accessibility` folder

     <img width="322" alt="how to access lighthouse accessibility report" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/106430584-eddaa000-6463-11eb-829e-5292749f16d2.PNG">
 
  2. Select to `Emulate vision deficiencies` in the `Rendering` section of Lighthouse. Select each vision deficiency and see whether the user is still able to navigate the site / view content ok

     <img width="323" alt="visionEmulation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/106431075-a86aa280-6464-11eb-90c9-50d071ec101f.PNG">
  3. Install the [SiteImprove](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc) plugin to Chrome and run a report on each of  the pages in your restaurant app.
    How many issues does SiteImprove find?
    Why could these issues cause issues for users with disabilities?
    Now edit your HTML to fix these issues
  4. Install [Screen Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) and tab through your website. If you were vision impaired, would you understand which restaurant you were viewing or deleting? If not, what could you do to improve site navigation for those using a screen reader.
  5. If you finish early, try checking out the accessibility of other websites too. Try the [ATG Ticket Website](https://atg.nliven.co/tickets/series/wicked?_ga=2.37698784.1776477192.1605217929-908196991.1605217929) with a Vision Deficiency of 'Achromatopsia' - how does it look?

## Lesson 2 - Using JavaScript in the browser

How can you run JavaScript in the browser? There are 2 main ways:

### Inline JavaScript

You can write JavaScript inline, within an HTML file by enclosing your JavaScript in a `<script>` tag. As the page loads in the browser the HTML file is read from top to bottom, and any JavaScript in a `<script>` tag is executed when the page loads.

As an example, [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs) scripts (which measure how users interact with your website) are added within the <head> tag: 

```js
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script>
    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
    ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>
<!-- End Google Analytics -->
```
### Loading JavaScript from a source file

You can also load JavaScript from a file by using the `<script>` tag and including the `src` HTML attribute to reference the file: 

```html
<script src="/main.js"></script>
```

When the JavaScript file (in this case `main.js`) has been loaded by the page, it will be executed. 

#### üêò Remember HTML files are read from the top down

If we have libraries, modules or 3rd party JavaScript that we want to load (e.g. Google Analytics), these should go in the `<head>` tag of the HTML page. 

JavaScript that targets HTML elements (usually our own application code) should be the final thing on the page to be included. In practice that means your application code should be included in a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag. This is because application code will often target an HTML element and if that element has not been loaded, our JavaScript will Error and Fail üòü.

### Organising JavaScript files

Within the Browser, it's very important to understand that each JavaScript file that is loaded, shares the 'global scope' of the open browser `window` object. For example, a class defined in one file, will be available for another file to access once they are both loaded on the page. Any script can freely define/delete/change/call anything in the global scope. This is not the case in `Node.js` where the global scope of a module is the module itself.

You can't use the file system in the browser. In `Node.js` we made use of `module.exports` and `require` to load multiple `.js` files on our page. This allowed us to separate our code into distinct units which made it easier to understand. However, it should be noted that loading of each separate JavaScript file specified by `require` involves a separate round trip to the server and, in addition, there is no guarantee of the order the files will be returned. 

Browsers don't have the `require` method defined, however you can use tools such as [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to allow you to use `module.exports` and `require` within your frontend code, in the same way that you would use it in Node.

You can also use'bundlers', for example, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [browserify](http://browserify.org/)  to take JavaScript you have written in multiple files and 'bundle' them (with any dependencies) into one single file that you can serve to the client. 

Tools such as [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and [watchify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watchify) can also help you develop JavaScript applications 're-bundling' the code when file changes are detected('hot reloading').

## Assignment
Try out the different ways of using JavaScript in front-end code by completing the following 2 assignments:

  1. Modify your restaurant code to include [Facebook 'like' and 'share' icons](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/) when you click on a restaurant. If you get problems seeing the icons, please disable 'Ad Blockers' in your browser.

     Notice how you are including a Facebook script. Once this script is included, you are able to use the Facebook 'like' CSS class.

   2. Now use inline JavaScript in your HTML to add a simple counter which increments each time the page is loaded:
```html
    <div>Number of page loads:
        <span id="Counter"></span>
    </div>
```
```javascript
<script>
    var n = localStorage.getItem('on_load_counter');
    if (n === null) {
        n = 0;
    }
    n++;
    localStorage.setItem("on_load_counter", n);
    document.querySelector('#counter').innerText = `Visits to this page: ${localStorage.getItem('on_load_counter')}`
</script>
```
---
## Lesson 3 - The HTML Document Object Model (DOM)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates an Object Model of the web page. To illustrate this, let's create a DOM representation of this JavaScript:

```js
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <section>
            <p id="intro">Introduction</p>
```

![simpleDom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/106388095-cc7ea300-63d4-11eb-94c5-bf25553a8968.png)

To access an element in an HTML page, you always go via the `document` object.

The most common way to access HTML elements with JavaScript is via their id, e.g.

```js
<script>
    const myElement = document.getElementById("intro");
</script>
```

The most common way to retrieve/change the content of an element is by using the `innerHTML` property, i.e.

```js
<script>
    document.getElementById("intro").innerHTML = "Background";
</script>
```

You can also change the value of an attribute using:

```js
<script>
    document.getElementById("intro").setAttribute("href", "/style2.css");
</script>
``` 
---
## Lesson 4 - The HTML DOM Events

## Learning Objectives

* Understand how the `event` object is 'injected' into event handlers
* Add event listeners to HTML elements
* Create event handlers in JavaScript and attach them to event listeners

## Lesson

JavaScript's main primitive is the `Object`. Let's create a simple HTML button that triggers a JavaScript `event` object.

```html
<button id="my-button" onclick="console.log(event)">Click me</button>
```

What kind of `event` is triggered? What else can you learn about the event that just happened? Where on earth does the `event` that we are console.logging come from anyway?

The `event` object (and it must be named 'event' not 'evt', 'e' or anything else) is injected by the browser into every event handler. In this example, we are using the HTML attribute `onclick`with a string value of the JavaScript we wish to run when the event is triggered. We can also have a named function defined in our `main.js` file and include that in the string of JavaScript that is run when the event is triggered.

```javascript
function myButtonHasBeenClicked(event) {
    console.log(event)
}
```
```html
<button onclick="myButtonHasBeenClicked(event)">Click me</button>
```

### Event Listeners & Event Handlers

`onclick` is an **event listener**. It listens for clicks. An event listener will have a companion called an **event handler**. `myButtonHasBeenClicked` is an 'event handler'. 

There are other ways to attach event listeners to elements in the DOM. For example, the code below is another way to do the same thing we are doing above, but just using JavaScript.

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('my-button');

button.addEventListener('click', myButtonHasBeenClicked);
```

Here, we use the DOM to navigate to the button via its id. Instead of adding the event listener inline, we add it to the instance of the element in JavaScript. We call `addEventListener` with 2 arguments, a string that is the name of the type of listener and the function to call (with the event object) to handle the event.

You can remove an event listener as follows:
```javascript
button.removeEventListener('click', myButtonHasBeenClicked)
```

## Assignment
To experience events in JavaScript you are going to create your own adventure game.

**Step 1** is to make use of a fun website called [Creepy Events](https://codepen.io/prosetech/pen/oRxMmZ) written by [Matthew MacDonald](https://medium.com/young-coder/playing-with-javascript-events-be12f922736f). Your objective is to wire up the JavaScript functions to the buttons and input boxes to complete the story.

**Step 2** is to create your own adventure game based on the code from Step 1 and making use of as many HTML DOM events as possible. As a minimum you should include:
  * onclick()
  * onmouseover()
  * input()
  * focus()
  * keydown()
  * keyup()
  * mouseenter()
  * resize()

## Lesson 5 - Frameworks (Optional)

## Learning Objectives

* Create a simple "To Do" list using the state, view, update design pattern in AppRun

## Materials needed

* [AppRun Manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iubYsseCr82Qlo_3pKlAVy0uKVIfMx-o/view?usp=sharing)

## Lesson

Developers use frameworks to help them organise their code. When lots of people work on a codebase having a pattern to follow makes it much easier for team members to join and add to the code. We are going to use a simple framework called AppRun. If you can use AppRun you will find learning React or Elm much easier.

Before we look at the framework lets think about the design pattern that underpins React, Elm and AppRun.

![state view update pattern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664104-a2ab2300-0b3c-11eb-8afd-233463f0218d.png)

Both Elm and Redux follow the same pattern. Your app has **state** (this is the data Model). You app renders a **view** of that state. The view can **trigger updates** to some or all of the state. That state update triggers a re-render and your view is redrawn to represent the new state. This kind of programming style is called 'event driven'. It is 'declarative' like a spreadsheet.

![example of a spreadsheet updating](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664166-3f6dc080-0b3d-11eb-9885-a55e42acf475.gif)

You know how a spreadsheet works. Once your spreadsheet is all setup (or 'declared'), if you change a value in one cell it can trigger updates to other cells that depend on that value. AppRun works like this.

### Load AppRun

To load AppRun, we simply create an HTML page with the content below. This loads the AppRun library in a `<script>` tag from `unpkg.com`. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/apprun/dist/apprun-html.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <main id="app"></main>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### State
State in AppRun is simply a plain JavaScript object. <u>ALL</u> the data in our app belongs here. Our 'TODO list' will be a simple array which holds all our tasks.

We'll create a `main.js` file to hold the state:

```javascript
const state = {
    tasks: []
}
```

### View

To display the tasks we need a `view` function. This function will receive the `state` object (i.e. list of tasks) and will return a string of HTML. This is like the templating we did with Handlebars, but AppRun's template syntax employs the full power of JavaScript expressions, while Handlebars‚Äô syntax is quite limited in comparison.

```javascript
const view = state => `
    <section>
        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
            ${state.tasks.map(task => `<li>${task.text}</li>`).join("")}
        </ul>
    <section>
    <section>
        <form>
            <input name="text" placeholder="Add a task" />
            <button>Add</button>
        </form>
    </section>
`
```
![empty tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664952-e6edf180-0b43-11eb-9fc1-8cbda429b42d.png)

Remember the `view` function is just JavaScript, so you can add branching logic, iteration, calculation and do other stunts, we will end up with a string of valid HTML that will get added to the root HTML node (the `<main id="app">` element).

### Update

We want to be able to add a task. This requires us to capture the form submission, get the form data, create a task and add that into the state. Our update object will be the <u>ONLY</u> thing that interacts with the state. This is the most tricky part of AppRun to understand.

```javascript
const update = {
    add: (state, form) => {
        const data = new FormData(form)
        const task = {
            id: window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(2)).join(""),
            text: data.get('text'),
            status: 0
        }
        state.tasks.push(task)
        return state
    }
}
```
What is going on here? We have a JavaScript object. The properties are the names of update functions. In the example above we have defined the 'add' update function. Every update function will receive the state as its first argument. It is injected (like the event object). If we give our update function an argument, that will appear as the second argument. We pass in the form instance. Use `new FormData(form)` to de-serialize the form data, then create a new object that represents a task. I am generating a random id. You can play with `window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(2))` in the browser console and see what it does. We then update the state, and finally as we must in each update function, we return the new version of the state.

This update will trigger a re-render of our view function.

### Event listeners

For this to work we need to add an event listener to our view, and add the update function as the event handler.

```html
<section>
    <form onsubmit="app.run('add', this); return false;">
        <input name="text" placeholder="Add a task" />
        <button>Add</button>
    </form>
</section>
```
What event are we listening for? Notice we call `app.run('add', this);` _this_ is the form. We return `false` as this will prevent the default behavior of the form submission reloading the page! Will all this declared we are ready to initiate our app. Add the following to your `main.js`

```javascript
app.start('app', state, view, update)
```
![with tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664960-f66d3a80-0b43-11eb-995d-b86eaec0a4c3.png)

## Assignment

* Implement the state -> view -> update design pattern
* Can you complete the CRUD operations for each task?
* Use the id property to make a status update to 1 indicating that the task has been completed.
* Use the id property to delete a task, you should only be able to delete a task once it has been marked as done.
