# Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 5

## Overview of the day

----

## Lesson 1 - Tests in the browser

## Learning Objectives

* Recall the purpose of system tests
* Set up cypress testing in your project

## Before we start

* You need your app in a state where you have some UI elements on the page
* Your app needs to run in a test mode

## Materials needed

* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Lesson

Your app will need to run in 3 different environments: Your laptop, the deployment server and when we are running tests. Before adding cypress system (or end-to-end) tests make sure your app can run in a test mode.

Then in your project folder run

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress mocha chai
```
Mocha and chai are testing dependencies for cypress.

### What does cypress do?

Have you been testing your app in the browser to make sure it works? Cypress can automate this for you. Encoding critical user journeys is incredibly valuable. It is much quicker than us clicking round the site.

### Getting started

Writing cypress tests is similar to the tests we have been writing with jest. The first thing we will need to do is have our app running in test mode.
