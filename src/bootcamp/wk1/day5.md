# Bootcamp > Week 1 > Day 5

## Overview of the day

Today is just about practicing what you have learnt so far.

## Lesson 1 - London Scooter Hire

## Learning Objectives

* Demonstrate the syntax for defining a class
* Set up Jest tests write unit tests for your classes
* Write Async tests

## Before we start

* Have your airports project in your github as a reference

## Materials needed

* N/A

## Lesson

Each turn of the event loop is called a 'tick'. setTimeout and setInterval are async functions that call their callback on the next tick, or when the timer expires.

## Assignment

You have been asked to create a scooter hire system. Electric scooters need to be charged at scooter charging stations. Users can only hire and unplug a scooter if the battery is fully charged. Users always use up the battery charge, so when a scooter is returned to a charging station, you can expect the battery to be empty. It takes about 2000 milliseconds to charge a scooter (you have to wait, it's async).

Use test driven development and create the classes and interactions that you feel capture this functionality.

Create a coverage report and share it with your coach via slack
