# Mod 1 > Week 2 > Day 3

## Overview of the day
Today we are going to learn about how to use OAuth to secure our API. 

## Learning Objectives
* Understand JWT tokens
* Understand the OAuth flow
* Understanding the advantages of OAuth over Basic Auth
* Implement OAuth using Auth0 https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/nodejs/01-authorization#configure-auth0-apis and https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow

## Before we start

## Materials needed

# Lesson 1
You need to sign up to Auth0, a service which implements OAuth and is used in many production systems - https://auth0.com/signup.
Use your personal and select your region as Europe and opt out of notifications. Create a PERSONAL account type.

Auth0 is commercial solution for adding authentication and authorization services to your applications. There are many [use cases](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started#use-cases-for-auth0) for using Auth0 but we are going to focus on using it to secure our API with OAuth.

OAuth - is used for authorising access to resources. OpenID Connect sits on top of OAuth which adds login and profile information (authentication). OpenID Connect allows one login to be used across multiple applications (single sign on).
