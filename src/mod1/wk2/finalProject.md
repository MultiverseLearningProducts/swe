# Mod 1 > Final Project

## Journal App

Your task is to create a journal app where users can record their thoughts each day. Your app is targeted at highly security-conscious users and will claim to be the most secure journaling app on the market! The minimum spec for your app is below:

### Minimum spec

-   Users need to sign-up/login before using the journal
-   Users can create, read, update and delete their own journal entries
-   A journal entry has a particular date associated with it (e.g. 13 July 2021)
-   Users should be able to delete their account (along with all their journal entries)
-   The app should include a "Security" page which descibes, in user-friendly (but accurate) terms, how your site will protect their data

### Lesson spec

-   You are free to choose your own tech stack (I'd recommend using the same you use at work)
-   Your backend (API + database) should be built **before** your UI
-   Your app's repository should be stored on Github
-   Your API should include unit tests

### Bonus Points

-   Document your API
-   Deploy your app (e.g. to Heroku)
-   Allow users to login using OpenID Connect
-   Allow users to share a given entry with a given user
-   Create end-to-end tests (e.g. using Cypress)
-   Anything else cool

## Session Attendance Logs

Each day of the project, you'll need to complete the appropriate log:

Week 2 day 3 > [attendance log](https://platform.multiverse.io/apprentice/attendance-log/185)

Week 2 day 4 > [attendance log](https://platform.multiverse.io/apprentice/attendance-log/186)

Week 2 day 5 > [attendance log](https://platform.multiverse.io/apprentice/attendance-log/187)
