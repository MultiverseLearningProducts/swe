# Mod 1 > Week 1 > Day 5

## Overview of the day

Today (and during next week) you will use the skills you have learnt from this week's training to create a RESTful web service to list the contacts for a specific user. You have the choice of implementing this web service in either Javascript (Node.js) or your second language e.g. Java.

## Learning Objectives

* Create an OpenAPI specification for the API in SwaggerHub
* Implement 2 different versions of the API
* Create a Mock Server for this API
* Implement the API in your language of choice, ensuring all errors return the appropriate status code
* Use client side Javascript to call this API, ensuring all errors are mapped to user friendly messages
* Discuss the security flaws with the solution and what we'll do next week to fix these!

## Before we start

## Materials needed

# Lesson 1
TODO - encourage apprentices to check in on each other during the day, create breakout rooms containing students working in the same language and ask them to review their code/support each other.
