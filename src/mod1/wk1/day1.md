# Mod 1 > Week 1 > Day 1

## Overview of the day

Today we are going to learn about Representational state transfer (REST) and what makes an API RESTful. We 
will use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to call some RESTful APIs and look in detail at the requests we send and responses we receive.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS
* Understand the different HTTP methods and which one is appropriate for modelling CRUD operations
* Understand the most common HTTP response codes and how these indicate success or failure in RESTful operations
* Become familiar with using Postman to call RESTful APIs 

## Before we start

* Ask apprentices to install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## Materials needed

# Lesson 1
TODO - we need to make this interactive, perhaps use breakout rooms and allocate different APIs for each group to call. Ask them to come back & present a description of the API / share screen to send request. Challenge could be to used advanced Postman features such as scripts.

TODO - fun activity could be to find the most obscure HTTP response code (my favourite is "I'm a teapot"). Could do a fun quiz where the answers are status codes!
