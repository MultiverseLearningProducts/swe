# Mod 1 > Week 1 > Day 1

## Overview of the day

Today we are going to learn about Representational state transfer (REST) and what makes an API RESTful. We 
will use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to call some RESTful APIs and look in detail at the requests we send and responses we receive.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS
* Understand the different HTTP methods and which one is appropriate for modelling CRUD operations
* Understand the most common HTTP response codes and how these indicate success or failure in RESTful operations
* Become familiar with using Postman to call RESTful APIs 

## Before we start

* Ask apprentices to install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
