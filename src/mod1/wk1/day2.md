# Mod 1 > Week 1 > Day 2

## Overview of the day

Today we are going to call some RESTful APIs using JavaScript and use the responses to display information in the browser as well as handle errors. We'll also look more closely at specific HTTP headers and understand how and why we might version a REST API.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand how to call RESTful APIS using (using the fetch() call)
* Understand how to interpret JSON responses
* Understand the meaning of key HTTP headers sent to / returned from a RESTful API call
* Understand the different ways RESTful APIs can be versioned
* Understand how to handle errors and the important of mapping these to user friendly messages

## Before we start

## Materials needed

# Lesson 1
TODO - include the Accept, Content-Type headers
TODO - get the apprentices to pair programme (one person driving) and then to present back. Would be nice to mix up the different cohorts so they get to know each other. Also need to think about ability levels.
