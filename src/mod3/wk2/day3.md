# Mod 3 > Week 2 > Day 3

## Overview of the day

Today we look at different software methodologies and come to see their strengths and weaknesses.

----

## Lesson 1 - Waterfall vs Agile

## Learning Objectives

*   Recognise that there are a number of different methodologies used for software development that can broadly be categorised as sequential or iterative / incremental, and that some of these are waterfall or agile methods.
*   Describe the main attributes and features of waterfall software development methods.
*   Describe the main attributes and features of agile software development.
*   Identify the main points of the Agile Manifesto:
    *   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    *   Working software over comprehensive documentation
    *   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    *   Responding to change over following a plan
*   Describe the primary similarities and differences between waterfall and agile software development methods.

## Scope

Let us now consider the design phase in the context agile and waterfall software development methodologies.

<td style="text-align:left"><h3>Incremental</h3><p>In the incremental method the design work is done before development begins. The designs might be created for all the different increments, so a set of designs for increment1, then another set of designs for increment2 etc. Whilst the scope of an increment is limited the design phase is not.</p></td>

<td style="text-align:left"><h3>Iterative</h3><p>With the iterative method design work is contained within an iterative cycle so is much shorter and smaller in scope.</p></td>

## Lesson

!(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTwX_FF-Y7d8lMz-hTKs6VFE2ozsHfMGyPVxYNy3NbjavUt-yKqeBTLk6EfF2aWx0o_SjMlyEBOSWwA/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000)

## Business and market contexts

Consider waterfall and agile based on the factors listed below.

*   Characteristics of market sectors and segments
*   Business drivers and desired outcomes
*   Market risk
*   Operational risk
*   Legal and regulatory requirements

## Assignment

In a piece of writing:

*   Explain the main principles of a waterfall approach to software development
*   Explain the main principles of an agile approach to software development
*   Summaries the main differences between waterfall and agile methods

## Lesson 2 - Dictionary of terms

## Learning Objectives

*   List and describe in outline different agile software development methodologies, including Scrum; Kanban; Extreme Programming (XP); Test Driven Development (TDD).
*   List and describe in outline different software development methods and approaches including [Unified Process (UP)](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/); V-model; spiral; Lean; DevOps.

## Assignment

In pairs can you create a dictionary of Agile methodologies? See the diagram below[.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jTCIICfjts4LewF8xExsGlowcjkbgFZ3Tv8CwCsqHFY/edit)

Create your presentation/slide show and upload it here: [Dictionary of Agile Assignment](https://applied.whitehat.org.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=7999&action=editsubmission) One pair will be selected at random to share their presentation on agile methodologies.
