# Mod 3 > Week 2 > Day 3

## Overview of the day

Today we look at the primary differences between the Waterfall and Agile software development methodologies.

----

## Lesson 

## Learning Objectives

*   Recognise that there are a number of different methodologies used for software development that can broadly be categorised as sequential or iterative / incremental, and that some of these are Waterfall or Agile methods.
*   Describe the main attributes and features of Waterfall software development methods.
*   Describe the main attributes and features of Agile software development.
*   Identify the main points of the Agile Manifesto:
    *   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    *   Working software over comprehensive documentation
    *   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    *   Responding to change over following a plan
*   Describe the primary similarities and differences between Waterfall and Agile software development methods.
*   List and describe in outline different agile software development methodologies, including Scrum; Kanban; Extreme Programming (XP); Test Driven Development (TDD).
*   List and describe in outline different software development methods and approaches including [Unified Process (UP)](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/); V-model; Spiral; Lean; DevOps.

## Lean
Lean software development takes lean manufacturing principles and applies them to the software development domain.

## Waterfall methodology
The Waterfall methodology uses a sequential approach to software development. Each stage of the SDLC is completed and signed off before the next stage commences.

## Iterative software development

### Spiral
The Spiral model is an risk-driven, iterative development process.

The Spiral model has four phases:
* Determine objectives
* Identify and resolve risks
* Develop and test
* Plan the next iteration

A project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations named 'Spirals'.

### Unified Process (UP) / Rational Unified Process (RUP)
The Unified Process (sometimes known as the _Rational_ Unified Process) is an iterative development methodology where development is organised in short, timeboxed iterations enabling adaptation to accommodate change. It is Use Case and UML model driven.

Each iteration consists of the following 4 phases:

* _Inception_ - development of the Business Case, Project Plan and high level Use Cases
* _Elaboration_ - functional and non-functional requirements analysis, detailed risk analysis, development of the software architecture
* _Construction_  - the system is built and tested
* _Transition_ - the system is deployed

## V-model
The V-model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing.

## DevOps
The term DevOps combines the terms 'Developers' and 'Operations'. 
DevOps focusses on the collaboration between developers and the operations team across the whole service lifecycle with the aim of rapid delivery of high-quality, robust software. 

DevOps relies heavily on automation (CI/CD).

## Agile methodology
### The Agile manifesto

Let us now consider the design phase in the context agile and waterfall software development methodologies.

### Scrum

### Kanban
'Kanban' is made up of two Japanese words, 'kan' which means _sign_ and 'ban' which means _board'.

Teams use a Kanban board to visualize the status of their tasks. Popular Kanban boards include, Trello and Jira.

### Extreme Programming (XP)
XP is a lightweight methodology focussed on the coding activity in the SDLC. It describes a better way to programme that takes the pressure off developers and results in higher quality software. 

There are 4 key values in XP:
* Communication
* Simplicity
* Feedback
* Courage 

Example XP practices include:

* Producing all software in pairs (pair-programming)
* Writing tests before code
* Integrating and testing the system several times a day

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test driven development describes a methodology where tests are written before the code is written.
