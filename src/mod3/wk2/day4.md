> _TASK_ - find job adverts for some of the generic software job roles above. Read the job descriptions. What kind of experience does the individual need? What salary can they expect?

### The role of the Project Manager
The project management life cycle is usually broken down into four phases: 
* initiation
* planning
* execution
* closure

The _Project Manager_ is responsible for the project's scope, budget, team and resources. They are ultimately accountable for the success or failure of the project. 

### Project Manager versus Scrum Master
A Scrum Master is NOT the same as a Project Manager.

A Scrum Master:
* Coaches team on SCRUM principles
* Facilitates the Daily Scrum (standup)
* Removes blockers that are hindering team members
* Ensures good communication between the team members

A Scrum Master does NOT manage budgets or project scope. 

### Product Owners versus Scrum Master
The Product Owner liaises with the Customer / other stakeholders to understand their needs and then plans and prioritises work for the SCRUM team.

## What is a Stakeholder
A Stakeholder refers to someone who is directly or indirectly affected by the outcome of a project.

## Project versus Programme
PRINCE2 is a project management method. PRINCE2 defines a _project_ as 'a temporary organisation that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to a specified business case'.

It also defines a _programme_ as a 'group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually'.

> _TASK_ - find job adverts for Project Manager and Programme Manager jobs. Read the job descriptions. Which job role has more responsibility?

## IT Service Management (ITSM)
Service Management ensures that an organisation can efficiently implement, deliver, management, and support IT services. It is end-user focussed. For example:

* monitoring against SLAs
* change management - co-ordinating changes to infrastructure and systems
* running an IT Helpdesk
* incident management - responding to service disruption
* asset management - recording & managing hardware and software assets
* handling service requests - e.g. software upgrade requests, password changes

## Operations Management
Operations Management manages all the components of an organisation's IT infrastructure and executes routine tasks required to support the operation of applications and services. It is internally focussed. For example:

* installing networks
* securing systems
* installation of hardware
* performing upgrades
* performing backups
* monitoring of performance

## Assignment
1. Research how software teams are organised in companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Are they functional, cross-functional (matrix) or project based teams? What is the reporting hierarchy?

1. Update your portfolio to describe the roles in your software development team and the reporting hierarchy.
