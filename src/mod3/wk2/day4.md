### The role of the Project Manager
The project management life cycle is usually broken down into four phases: 
* initiation
* planning
* execution
* closure

The _Project Manager_ is responsible for the project's scope, budget, team and resources. They are ultimately accountable for the success or failure of the project. 

## Project versus Programme
PRINCE2 is a project management method. PRINCE2 defines a _project_ as 'a temporary organisation that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to a specified business case'.

It also defines a _programme_ as a 'group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually'.

## Service Management
Service Management ensures that an organisation can efficiently implement, deliver, management, and support IT services e.g.

* monitoring against SLAs
* change management
* incident management
* asset management
* service requests e.g. password changes
* disaster recovery

## Operations Management
Operations Management manages all the components of an organisation's IT infrastructure e.g.

* network operations
* provisioning of hardware
* backups
