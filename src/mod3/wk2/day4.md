Can you identify some of these roles and responsibilities in the teams that you work in?

# Assignment ðŸ¤”

Can you create a piece of writing that briefly explains the roles listed above. i.e requirements engineer - a requirements engineer is responsible for eliciting requirements, they often work with a business analyst employing a set of different techniques like interviewing or shadowing to research, discover and finally define a set of software requirements.

## Lesson 2 - Team Structures

## Learning Objectives

*   Recognise that software development teams may be structured in different ways, depending on organisational considerations.
*   Distinguish at a high-level between a functional structure, a project structure and a matrix structure.
*   Describe the roles and responsibilities of the main functions that typically interface with software development teams, including:
    *   Customer Business Units
    *   Operations
    *   Service Management
    *   Service Desk
    *   Application Support
    *   Technical Support

* Recognising that different organisations may use different titles and different combinations of functions.
*   Explain how the main roles and functions external to the software development team (listed above) interface with the software development team and at which stages of the SDLC these interactions occur.

*   Describe in outline a generic project lifecycle and the purpose and scope of each stage of the lifecycle, the stages being:
    *   initiation
    *   planning

    *   completion / closure
*   Describe effective team-working and how this contributes to effective delivery of software projects, including, organisational behaviour theory; decision making; conflict resolution; collaboration; communication.
*   Explain the importance of working closely with the customer and users during requirements analysis.
*   Explain the role of technical architects and domain experts during design.
*   Explain the role of Operations and Service Management during design, in order to help ensure that the design of the software end product meets non-functional requirements.
*   Explain ways in which team working is beneficial during code development, including learning from others; reviewing each othersâ€™ work; aiding communication; sharing the workload; utilising strengths and weaknesses of team members; providing motivation and support; contributing to retrospectives.
*   Explain why collaborative approaches are especially important for software development using agile and/or DevOps approaches.
