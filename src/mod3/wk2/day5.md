Exam notes:

* Each apprentice will be in a separate call - all the GoogleMeet links are different.
* The software you use has a timer in the top right that counts down how much time you have left of your exam, the timer starts as soon as you start your exams. If they have extra time, this will be reflected in the timer - the software will also notify you just before the start that you have extra time applied.
* If you finish early you can leave BUT only after the invigilator has gone over some post-exam stuff with you (confirming your result/discussing the rebook process with them). You must not leave the call and software without speaking to the invigilator first.

Good luck for your exam!
