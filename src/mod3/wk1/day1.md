# Exam overview
The purpose of this exam is to ensure that apprentices are able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of Software Development Methodologies as required by the [IfATE standards](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/software-developer-v1-0), specifically:

1. Understand and operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle.
2. Understand the similarities and differences (taking into account the positives and
negatives of both approaches) between agile and waterfall software development
methodologies.
3. Understand how teams work effectively to produce software and contribute
appropriately.

## Exam format
The exam consists of 40 multiple-choice question which must be completed within 1 hour. The pass mark is 26/40 (65%).

The exam is currently taken remotely and you are required to install specific software on your computer to allow remote invigitation.

The exam marks are split as follows:
* 50% of the marks are awarded for knowledge of the role and function of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
* 20% of the marks are awarded for knowledge of Software Development Methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall
* 30% of the markes are awarded for knowledge of the Roles and Responsibilities within a software team

## Exam pre-requisites
* Read the email from exams@multiverse.io entitled "Tech Requirements for your Upcoming BCS Software Development Methodologies Exam" and ensure you have all the pre-requisite hardware and software installed. 
* Ensure you have completed your registration for the BCS Candidate Portal (you should have received an email from certifications@bcs.uk)previously emailed to you and can login to the BCS Candidate Portal at https://eprofessional.bcs.org/Portal/Candidate/Login
* Ensure you have an invite in your diary for your exam date sent from exams@multiverse.io

# Lesson 1 - The SDLC

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the role and function of the software development lifecycle
* Relate the seven generic stages of the software development lifecycle 

The purpose of the SDLC is to specify a set of steps to create a software end-product. It guides us in turning business requirements into operational IT systems.

The 7 stages of the SDLC are listed below.


![The 7 stages of the SDLC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/141513299-3b05720a-284b-4ac8-b936-33c621536f8a.png)


Note that you will see variations of these terms on-line and in literature however these are the terms used by the BCS hence we will use these through this module.

The high level purpose of each stage is described below, we will discuss each stage in detail in future lessons.

|**Stage**|**Purpose**|
|---------|-----------|
|Feasibility Study|Determine if the project is worthwhile|
|Requirements Engineering|Obtain the user requirements|
|Design|Design the system|
|Development|Write the code|
|Testing|Test the software|
|Implementation|Deploy the software|
|Maintenance|Support the software|

> Remember that your portfolio will need to evidence projects which cover all of the above stages of the software lifecycle (excluding Feasibility Study)

# Lesson 2 - Feasibility Study stage

## Learning Objectives

*   Explain how software development is initiated when a need or an opportunity is identified.
*   Describe the purpose and main activities of a feasibility study.
*   Explain why it is important to plan software development.
*   Explain the purpose of a business case.
*   Describe potential tangible and intangible benefits that can be achieved using operational software, including:
    *   cost savings
    *   productivity gains
    *   risk reduction
    *   time savings
    *   increased income
*   Demonstrate a simple cost benefit analysis for a given case.

## Purpose
> A feasibility study involves investigation and research to evaluate a project's potential for success. 

The idea for a project can come from a number of different places.

*   Market forces from competitors
*   New technologies
*   Changes in regulations
*   Identifying a gap in the market

For example, modern banking apps like Monzo and Starling introduced the ability to freeze a debit card via an app. Other banks saw this and reacted to the competition by implementing this same feature for their own customers. This is an example of a SDLC being driven by business needs.

Listen to this [Dragon's Den pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf4zNLxJZnY) - do you think the idea is feasible? 

## Creating a Feasibility Study
A feasibility study considers the following:
* **Business** feasibility 
   * can we get the project out ahead of our competitors?
   * does the project fit with our organisational culture/goals?
* **Technical** feasibility
   * do we have suitably skilled developers?
   * do we have infrastrure to support the rollout?
* **Financial** feasibility
   * can the project be done within budget?
   * will there be an acceptable return on investment?

### Cost Benefit Analysis / Return on Investment
The financial feasibility is determined based on whether the benefits outweigh the costs of delivery. 

Costs and benefits can be either:
   * _Tangible_ (easily measureable e.g. cost savings) 
   * _Non-tangible_ (harder to measure e.g. increase in staff morale)

**Cost Benefit Analysis** takes into account the non-tangible benefits
**Return on Investment (ROI)** only takes into account tangible benefits.

The cost-benefit or ROI ratio is calculated as follows:
> Cost-benefit (or ROI) ratio = benefits / cost

If a project has a cost-benefit or ROI ratio greater than 1.0, the project is expected to deliver value.

Let's consider 2 examples.

> **Example 1.** A new (fourth) lane on the M1 is to be constructed. The costs and benefits of this road are as follows:
> 
> 1.  £7.5million reduction in accidents calculated from life insurance values
> 2.  £3.2million in planning applications
> 3.  £2million in time-saving calculated from leisure preferences
> 4.  £6.5million in materials
> 5.  £6million for labour
> 6.  £3.5million for displacement of households
> 7.  £11million in time-savings calculated from wages

❓ What is the cost benefit ratio (rounded to 2 decimal places)

❓ Given the cost benefit ratio of the above should you go ahead with the 4th lane?

> **Example 2.** A financial technology startup is expanding and adding two new programmers. The CEO of the company decides to run a cost benefit analysis to determine whether the decision will be beneficial to the company - and to what degree.  
>   
> The company estimates that revenue would increase by around £100,000 if the two programmers were hired.  
>   
> On the cost side of the equation, the CEO must examine the cost of the two programmer’s salaries - estimated at £55,000\. Additionally, there is the cost of recruitment, which might be around £3,000\. Equipment could add an additional £4,000.  
>   

❓ What is the cost benefit ratio (rounded to 2 decimal places)?

❓ Should the CEO hire 2 new programmers?

### Business Case
A Business Case document is created after the Feasibility Study and provides the justification for undertaking the project. It typically consists of the following sections:

* Management Summary
* Background
* Options and alternatives considered
* Benefits
* Costs
* Impacts
* Risks
* Conclusion & recommendations


## Roles involved in the Feasibility Study stage
* Business Analyst
* Project Sponsor
...


## Assignment
Choose one of the following Feasibility Studies to review (no need to read it all, just the Executive Summary and table of contents)

* [Feasibility Study of the Network Rail southern connection to Heathrow Airport](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Southern-Rail-Access-to-Heathrow-Feasibility-Study.pdf)

* [Feasibility Study into the Establishment of a National Musical Instrument Fund](https://www.musicnetwork.ie/content/files/NMIF-feasibility-study-FINAL-report-28-07-14.pdf)

* [Esports Feasibility Report](https://www.hereeast.com/documents/18/HEREEAST-210125_Esports_Feasibility_Report_Final.pdf)

Now skim through a Business Case and see how this differs in structure to the Feasibility Study

* [Business Case for Lydney Cycling Improvements](https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/media/2084418/lydney-cycling-improvements-full-business-case.pdf)

* [Business Case for an A4 Corridor Cycle Scheme](https://www.slough.gov.uk/downloads/file/718/a4-corridor-cycle-scheme-full-business-case)

* [Business Case for Heathrow Airport North West Runway](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374664/evidence-base-heathrow-north-west-final.pdf)
