# Mod 3 > Week 1 > Day 1

## Overview of the day

Give the apprentices an overview of the 7 stages of the Software Developement Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Learning Objectives

* Recognise that there are several ways to represent the terminology and stages of the SDLC.
* Describe the role of the SDLC in the context of developing of IT systems and services, and operational software end-products.
* Explain the purpose of the SDLC as a means to facilitate the creation of effective software.

## Before we start

* Make sure apprentices have started their portfolio's and they are able to access them and edit their documents (try to have them set up in [https://papper.whitehatcoaches.org.uk](https://papper.whitehatcoaches.org.uk))

## Materials needed

* [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT-jjCXgRttr3Iup8KVPz1sja4uIYeMoPwim0YQsDF3eoXyjoC1Cu8vXsDHQxDootrmR4oIsFmTYm6b/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

# Lesson 1 - Introduction to the SDLC

![BCS Software Methodologies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/74535594-076e9900-4f2e-11ea-990c-1dda13f0e278.png)

The function of the SDLC is to translate business requirements through a structured set of processes to operational IT systems.

The role of the SDLC is to remove the unpredictable ‚Äúhuman element‚Äù and replace it with structured and managed processes. This makes possible the construction of larger more complex IT systems.

It is important to appreciate that the essence of this module is internalising the formula and systems for creating mission impact with software. It‚Äôs going to make you a professional software engineer with savvy business awareness.

Whilst we learn about these abstract ideas and concepts it is essential that you make them come to life by applying them back to your own experiences and business environment.

Frameworks are abstract structures to help support our understand of complex systems. Frameworks give us:

*   Labels
*   Patterns
*   Incomes and outcomes

Like a recipe is only a representation of a dish that you could make, a framework is also just a recipe for an outcome. Our task in the module is to learn the labels, learn the patterns, understand the outputs of the SDLC and apply it to our own experiences.

## Assignment

*   Feasibility Study
*   Requirements Engineering
*   Design
*   Development
*   Testing
*   Implementation
*   Maintenance

Memorise these 7 stages of the SDLC. You will see variations of these on-line and in literature. These are the 7 terms that BCS use so we are going to use them.

# Lesson 2 - Feasibility Study

## Learning Objectives

*   Explain how software development is initiated when a need or an opportunity is identified.
*   Describe the purpose and main activities of a feasibility study, including:
    *   technical feasibility
    *   financial feasibility
    *   collection of information
    *   assessment of risks and implications
    *   consideration of alternatives
    *   feasibility report writing
*   Explain why it is important to plan software development.
*   Explain the purpose of a business case.
*   Describe potential tangible and intangible benefits that can be achieved using operational software, including:
    *   cost savings
    *   productivity gains
    *   risk reduction
    *   time savings
    *   increased income
*   Demonstrate a simple cost benefit analysis for a given case.

## Before we start

* You should be able to recall the 7 stages of the SDLC

## Materials needed

* [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTT3P1ioBFXXr7u0hNMmx03XYMMydTxmYJ7GUS0IK6lxySP9O-3fobzpAjV8cjY2uNm2KlzVJkrye-I/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

## Lesson

The inputs for the feasibility study are business needs.

## Inputs

The initial input to the SDLC can come from a number of different places.

*   Market forces from competitors
*   New technologies
*   Changes in regulations
*   Identifying a gap in the market

This first phase of the SDLC looks at the aims of the business and the environment that it is operating in and asks the question ‚Äúwhat should we be doing to fulfil our aims?‚Äù.

That might be reacting to competitors. For example modern banking apps like Monzo and Starling introduced the ability to freeze a debit card from an app. Other banks saw this and reacted to the competition by implementing this same feature for their own customers. This is an example of a SDLC being driven by business needs.

During the feasibility study executive staff figure out what their organisation should do next. This period of research and decision making is often dominated by the economic principle of **Return on Investment** (ROI).

### Return on Investment

> Return on investment (ROI) is a ratio between net profit (over a period) and cost of investment (resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment‚Äôs gains compare favourably to its cost.

To become more familiar with this concept can you work your way through these two examples:

> **Example 1.** A new (fourth) lane on the M1 is to be constructed. The costs and benefits of this road are as follows:
> 
> 1.  ¬£7.5million reduction in accidents calculated from life insurance values
> 2.  ¬£3.2million in planning applications
> 3.  ¬£2million in time-saving calculated from leisure preferences
> 4.  ¬£6.5million in materials
> 5.  ¬£6million for labour
> 6.  ¬£3.5million for displacement of households
> 7.  ¬£11million in time-savings calculated from wages

> **Example 2.** A financial technology startup is expanding and adding two new programmers. The CEO of the company decides to run a cost benefit analysis to determine whether the decision will be beneficial to the company - and to what degree.  
>   
> The company is analysing a time horizon of one year, and estimates that revenue would increase some 50% if the two programmers were hired.  
>   
> On the cost side of the equation, the CEO must examine the cost of the two programmer‚Äôs salaries - estimated at ¬£75,000\. Additionally, there is the cost of recruitment, which might be around ¬£3,000\. Training could add an additional ¬£4,000.  
>   
> Additionally, there is the cost of new work areas and computers, totalling ¬£5,000, and the cost of additional licensing for software and the like, around ¬£2,000.  
>   
> When calculating benefits, the CEO would examine the benefit of additional revenue within a 12 month period, estimated around ¬£100,000\. Additionally, the increase in product quality resulting from the new programmers (and therefore presumed customer satisfaction) would increase by 10%, adding an estimated ¬£10,000 in value to the company, within a 12 month period.

For the resources and investment will the organisation see a benefit that out weights this cost? This is what this phase of the SDLC is concerned with and will distill all this thinking into an output.

## Output

The output of this phase is a feasibility study for the executives running the organisation. A statement "we should do this", or "we need to offer this service" is usually at the conclusion of the document, with data and evidence backing up the recommendations.

This output forms the input for the next phase of the software development life cycle.
