# Mod 4 > Week 1 > Day 4

## Overview of the day

You should consider a design system for your app. Implementing a design system demonstrates your knowledge of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A design system is made of three things:

* Rules
* Constraints
* Principles

## Learning Objectives

* Demonstrate you can develop user interface coding and implementation
* Demonstrate you can apply the fundamental concepts of human-computer interaction or user experience design.

## Lesson

Apple and Google both use design systems. Apple's is/was called Cupertino (now I think they call it [UIkit](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/)), while Google's is/was called [Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction). These systems organise UI elements for you and make sound design decisions so you don't have to. Using a design system will make your app look and feel professional. It will also save you time.

Below are some of the systems you need sound reasons not to use.

* [Bootstrap ](https://getbootstrap.com/) (HTML)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) (React)
* [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) (React)
* [IBM Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) (HTML, React)

## Design system

You need components for responsive layouts, forms and lists. Select a design system and practice using it.
