# Bootcamp Overview

This 5-week Flying Start bootcamp prepares new apprentices to enter the workplace ready for their first challenges. We cover the basics of the **software development life cycle** and begin to understand the role of a software developer. As well as learning the basics of programming in HTML and JavaScript, apprentices will take on coding challenges and gain practical experience of the entire software stack.

The knowledge covered in the 5 week bootcamp will be referenced in all 4 modules for building retention of the competencies.

-   **Week 1:** This week introduces test driven development (TTD) and Object Oriented programming (OOP). Apprentices will create a series of objects in their program and then write the code so these objects interact with each other through inheritance and association. They will also be introduced to asynchronous JavaScript functions.
-   **Week 2:** This week introduces object oriented analysis and design (OOAD) using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). Apprentices will also learn SQL (using SQLite as a simple database)and use ORM tools to create applications that can persist their state.
-   **Week 3:** This week introduces the RESTful design pattern and how to create APIs to create, read, update and delete resources using Node.js Express middleware. Focus will be given to the importance of server-side validation to prevent injection attacks. Apprentices will use templating frameworks to create dynamic content in web pages and learn how to create responsive applications. They will develop a full-stack restaurant website to showcase their skills developed over the past 3 weeks.
-   **Week 4:** This week starts with an introduction to Web Accessibility and requires the apprentices to assess their website for conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The rest of the week is focussed on the HTML DOM model and DOM events such as drag and drop.
-   **Week 5:** Apprentices demonstrate the skills they have learnt in the last month through a week-long, group project that includes a design phase, a testing strategy, a database, a server and a frontend.

**Standards Covered in Bootcamp**

-   Technical Competencies:
    -   Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language

**Assessments during Bootcamp**

Each week there will be a new topic that builds upon each other. As in software development there are many moving parts to a project, each day during the week apprentices will learn a new aspect that will link to the overall project of the week.

For each day and end of week, apprentices will submit their work via GitHub and receive comments from their coach. Apprentices should be prepared to share their work to others in the cohort as well.

Below is an overview of each assessment for the week:

-   **Week 1:** Create a scooter hire system. Apprentices are introduced to the idea of Object Orientated Programming (OOP), Test Driven Development (TDD), static class functions, inherticance, and asynchronous functions.
-   **Week 2 and 3 :** Build a restaurant app like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. As this app will incorporate many aspects and be deployed as a full stack app, apprentices will work multiple weeks on this project. In week 2, apprentices focus on creation of the database for the app and more of the backend supports. Apprentices are introduced to UML data models, unit tests, working with SQLite, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), and working with Sequelize.
-   **Week 3:** Continue work on restaurant app. Apprentices build upon the code created in week 2. This week, apprentices will focus building a front-end development aspects for the app. Apprentices are introduced to how to build a webserver, create dynamic HTML content, work with templates and arrays of data, implement a responsive CSS grid, creating routes, adding images, and working with Postman
-   **Week 4:** Create a Kanban app (tasks app) . Apprentices turn theitr attention to the browser. They begin looking at Web Accessibility, HTML Document Object Model (DOM), HTML DOM Events and how to write JavaScript in the browser. There is also a focus on using the event object and event listeners with HTML.
-   **Week 5:** In groups, apprentices continue to build their Kanban app to be deployed and shared at the end of the week. They model the software development lifecycle, working on an app in teams and developing individual features to the project themselves. The focus is in modeling the skills and behaviors needed to communicate and work on a team to deploy a full stack application.

**Assessments in Module 4**

In Module 4, you will prepare for the 5 day synoptic project. To do this, you will select the stack you will use for the synoptic project - and implement user accounts to demonstrate that everything works OK. You will need to implement a testing strategy, then the design system. Once the coding is complete, you will create a video demo showcasing their project and explaining how it meets the brief.

This module has a lot of coding to help you gain familiarity with frameworks, libraries or APIs that you can use in the synoptic project.

While you finish Module 4 they will have a few opportunities to work on projects to showcase their knowledge and skills. As you complete each session you will add more to your synoptic projects. The projects are the following an in each session:

-   **Stacks Project:** Apprentices should decide on a stack that they will use in their synoptic project. Create a new application with their stack and implement user accounts.
-   Data Design: Create a data design for their chosen synoptic project Read the brief carefully and think about what needs to be captured from the use, what needs to be stored and how they will persist the relationships between different data points.
-   **Testing:** Can you bootstrap your project with each type of test: Unit, Integration and system? You don’t need to write extensive tests for your application, but you do want to demonstrate in your synoptic project that you know about testing strategies and you know how to set up and write each of the three types of test.
-   **Design Systems:** Look over the design systems and pick one that works with your synoptic project. Make sure that your project includes components for responsive layouts, forms and lists.
