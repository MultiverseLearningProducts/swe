# Foundations

You are going to lay the foundations of your programming career by learning JavaScript as your first language.

Learning javascript means you will be able to write programmes that run in a web browser, and on a server. By combining these two different environments you will have the power to build full stack applications.

We'll learn by:

* Paying close attention to our study materials and the code we write
* Being actively engaged with the material we work with
* Having effective error correction from our coach
* Consolidating our learning through practice and sleeping

The pattern for our foundation course is as follows:

* Online independent study to learn syntax and concepts
* Coaching sessions to challenge our knowledge and direct our learning
* Practical exercises to consolidating our learning
* Teaching things we have learnt

## Step 1

1. In the course called: __Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)__ - Complete the first course called: __Basic Javascript__
1. Contact your coach when you have completed this.

## Step 2

### FizzBuzz

There is a party game called FizzBuzz. For every number that is divisible by 3 you have to say _fizz_ instead of the number, for every number that is divisible by five you have to say _buzz_ instead of the number, for every number that is both divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 you have to replace that number with the word _fizzbuzz_.

> -1-2-fizz-4-buzz-fizz-7-8-fizz-buzz-11-fizz-13-14-fizzbuzz-...

ðŸ”± Can you write a programme that will printout the numbers 1 - 100 and replace the right numbers with the right words?

## Step 3

### Array Structures

How do you:

1. create an array?
1. add items to an array?
1. remove items from an array?
1. Access items in an array?
1. Can you place an array in an array?
1. Can you make a grid structure 3 x 3?
1. Can you put items in the grid structure?
1. Can you reference items in the grid structure i.e. _array[2][1]_

ðŸ”± Can you create a grid 3x3 and then place counters `O` or `X` at places in the grid (like you were playing noughts and crosses)?

## Step 4

### Array Functions

1. map over an array
1. filter an array
1. reduce an array
