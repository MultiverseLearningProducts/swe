    <h2>Lesson 1 - Authentication and authorisation</h2>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Understand the difference between authentication and authorisation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Understand how user names and passwords are encoded in the Basic Authentication HTTP scheme</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><code>Authentication</code> is the process of verifying who a user is</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><code>Authorisation</code> is the process of verifying what they have access to</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's an example to illustrate this:</p>
        <p>Imagine you have booked a hotel room. When you get to the checkout you are asked for you driving license to prove who you are - this is <strong>authentication</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/102709159-a9be8200-429f-11eb-903b-12976c1f051d.png" alt="hotel checkin">
    </p>
    <p>Once authentication is complete, you are given a key card which gives you entry to your room - this is <strong>authorisation</strong> as you are being granted access to a resource (in this case your room). You are not authorised to access any other rooms.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/102709120-43d1fa80-429f-11eb-9d57-43906703fbf9.png" alt="hotel keycard">
    </p>
    <h3>üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíªüë©üèæ‚Äçüíª Assignment</h3>
    <p>In breakout rooms, determine which of the following are examples of authentication and which are examples of authorisation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Showing your passport at the airport</li>
      <li>Determining which floor in a building an employee can access</li>
      <li>Checking a boarding pass before boarding a flight</li>
      <li>A manager accessing payroll information</li>
      <li>Entering a username and password</li>
      <li>Using biometrics (such as fingerprints)</li>
      <li>Using a key to open a door</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Basic Authentication</h2>
    <p>Now we have our API we need to consider how we will secure access to the API. For this we will use a username and password, commonly known as <code>Basic Authentication</code>.</p>
    <p>Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme that is built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends an HTTP request with an <code>Authorization</code> header that contains the word <code>Basic</code> followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Authorization: Basic ZnJlZC5mbGludHN0b25lQHdoaXRlaGF0Lm9yZy51azpteXBhc3N3MHJk</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That long string of numbers and letters after the word "Basic" is a base64 encoded string. You can encode and decode base64 strings in your browser using a pair of functions called <code>atob</code> and <code>btoa</code>. Try it. In your console encode the following string "Hello you".</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Assignment</h3>
    <p>From the string in the <code>Authorization</code> header above, determine the user's username and password.</p>
    <p>‚ùì Do you think Basic Authentication is a secure scheme?</p>
    <h2>Hashing passwords</h2>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand why passwords should be hashed</li>
      <li>Understand the implications of exposing sensitive data</li>
      <li>Create a database of user names and hashed passwords</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basic auth uses the <code>Authorization</code> header in the HTTP request, along with the "Basic" keyword and a base64 encoded string in the following format <em>username:password</em>. To validate that a user's login details are correct using Basic auth the server will look in the headers for this base64 encoded string and decode it. Now the server has the username and password sent from the client we need to match it with the username and password held in our database.</p>
    <p>‚ùì Imagine if we held all our user's passwords in plaintext. What risks do you think this could cause?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer</strong> - we will have leaked sensitive information that your users have trusted you with. Imagine if they used the same username and password on other sites. Your organisation could face very large fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and suffer serious damage to its repretation - listen to this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48905907">video</a> to hear about one recent example.</p>
    <p>To avoid storing passwords in plaintext, we <code>hash</code> them with an one-way hashing function. You learnt about hashing last week. If the cryptographic function used for the hashing is strong, then it's computationally impossible to calculate the original password from the hash.</p>
    <p>As a reminder, here is some code which implements a secure hashing algorithm:</p>
    <nav class="tabbed-code-block"><a href="#javascript">Javascript</a><a href="#java">Java</a></nav>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')
...
bcrypt.hash('password101', 10).then(console.log)
// $2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-java">import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

//...
BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
String hashedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode("your password");
// $2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK
</code></pre>
    <p>Once you have your hash you can check it like this:</p>
    <nav class="tabbed-code-block"><a href="#javascript">Javascript</a><a href="#java">Java</a></nav>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">bcrypt.compare('password101', '$2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK').then(console.log)
// true
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-java">BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
boolean isMatch = passwordEncoder.match("your password", "$2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK");
// true
</code></pre>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>Use the code above to generate hashes of some demo user passwords. Then add the usernames and their hashed passwords to a database.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 4 - Creating and Securing a User API</h2>
    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the middleware design pattern</li>
      <li>Use what you have learnt in previous lessons to secure an API using Basic Auth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lesson</h3>
    <p>Your API should support a `User' resource. A user will need at least a name, email and password:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>HTTP Method</th>
          <th>URL</th>
          <th>Status code</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>GET</td>
          <td><code>/users</code></td>
          <td>200</td>
          <td>retrieve all users</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>POST</td>
          <td><code>/users</code></td>
          <td>201</td>
          <td>create a new user</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>GET</td>
          <td><code>/users/{id}</code></td>
          <td>200</td>
          <td>retrieve a specific user</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>PUT</td>
          <td><code>/users/{id}</code></td>
          <td>200</td>
          <td>update a user</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>DELETE</td>
          <td><code>/users/{id}</code></td>
          <td>200</td>
          <td>delete a user</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Our User resource in an unsecured state is just like any other resource like airports, training shoes or albums. However we are going to treat it differently.</p>
    <p>To protect resources we need to authenticate the user making the request. We are using basic auth to do that by putting the <em>username:password</em> in the headers of the request.</p>
    <p>Our server now needs to check the request is authentic and from a user it knows before responding. That check needs to happen before we respond.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*Fnreje0WgqdBjjLXop9L0A.png" alt="middleware diagram">
    </p>
    <p>As that check happens in the middle of the request response cycle, it has been given the name of middleware. This is a generic design pattern you will see in many systems.</p>
    <p>A whole series of things can happen in middleware not just authentication, but also authorisation. Thats why the diagram above has 2 middleware rings. There are 2 middlewares the request has to pass through before it gets to the controller. Below is a general pattern for a middleware function.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function (request, response, next) {
  // check or change something in the request
  // maybe its not ok so from here you might
  return response.code(403) // status code 403 forbidden
  // the controller was never reached!
  // maybe all is well and you can contiune with the request
  // calling next() finishes this middleware and goes onto
  // either the next middleware or into the controller/route handler itself
  return next()
}
</code></pre>
    <p>‚ùì What other things might you want to do in middleware?</p>
    <p>‚ùì is the password sent on every request or cached?</p>
    <p>We are going to implement middlewares on our server. First of you need to authenticate the request and only accept requests from users your server knows about (the users in your database). We don't want any user to be able to see a list of all the other users, that is our authorisation rule.</p>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an API which allows Create, Read, Update and Delete of a User using either SpringBoot or Node.js</li>
      <li>Add sessions so authenticated users continue to have access to the <code>/users/:id</code> end point.</li>
      <li>Enhance your API to check the incoming username and password against the details held in the database you created in the previous lesson</li>
      <li>(Optional) Create a simple form which sends a username and password to your API using Basic Auth (i.e. simulates what Postman was doing in the previous lesson).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Protect your Create, Read, Update and Delete user resources with Basic Authentication using the following code:</p>
    <nav class="tabbed-code-block"><a href="#javascript">Javascript</a><a href="#java">Java</a></nav>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">// check for a basic auth header with correct credentials
app.use(basicAuth({
  authorizer: dbAuthorizer, // customer authorizer,
  authorizeAsync: true, // we check the db which makes this async
  challenge: true,
  unauthorizedResponse: (req) => {
    return `unauthorized. ip: ${req.ip}`
  }
}));

// our custom async authorizer middleware, this is called for each request
function dbAuthorizer(username, password, callback) {
  const sql = "select password from users where username = ?;";
  db.get(sql, [username], async (err, user) => {
    err ? callback(err) : bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, callback);
  });
