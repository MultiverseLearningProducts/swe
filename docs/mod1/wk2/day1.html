    <h1>Mod 1 > Week 2 > Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we are going to learn about session-based auth and how to use OAuth to secure our API.</p>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the limitations of Basic Auth</li>
      <li>Know why and how to use Sessions on a server</li>
      <li>Understand the structure and purpose of JWT</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure you have the Postman application installed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Postman application</li>
      <li>VS Code (for Javascript development) or IntelliJ (for Java development)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Lesson 1 - Sessions</h1>
    <h2>What's wrong with Basic Auth?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The password is sent over the wire in base64 encoding which can be easily decoded</li>
      <li>The password is sent repeatedly i.e. on each request meaning there is a large attack window</li>
      <li>The password is cached by the web browser, therefore it could be silently reused by any other request to the server e.g. CSRF</li>
      <li>The password may be stored permanently in the browser hence could be stolen by another user on a shared machine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sessions</h2>
    <p>Wouldn't it be much better if after being authenticated the server could keep track of which users it had already checked the passwords for. This is the purpose of sessions on a server. They are a means by which the server can keep track of who is who. Without sessions our server will just treat each request the same.</p>
    <p>Lets have a look at trying to manage state on our server. Lets be really simple and just imagine we have a counter.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">class Counter {
    constructor() {
        this.value = 1;
    }

    inc() {
        this.value += 1;
        return this.value.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>We want to expose this to our users so they can make requests and receive incrementing values i.e. 1,2,3,4,5 etc</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get("/counter", (req, res) => {
    const counter = new Counter();
    res.send(counter.inc());
});
</code></pre>
    <p>❓ What is the problem with this?</p>
    <p>Lets pull the counter out of the route and have it in the scope of the server instance:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const counter = new Counter();

app.get("/counter", (req, res) => {
    res.send(counter.inc());
});
</code></pre>
    <p>❓ What is the problem with this? (try different browser windows)</p>
    <p>The behaviour we are after is each connected client gets their own dedicated counter. So as they refresh their individual page, their personal counter increments.</p>
    <p>For this we will need to extend our server by adding sessions. The session object will be added to the request object. Each individually connected client will be allocated a <code>req.session.id</code> unique to them and there interaction with the server. On the session object we can store values for that connection. For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">req.session.user_id = user.id;
</code></pre>
    <p>You can only store JSON stringable values so our instance of our counter cannot be stored as it will get turned into the string representation of the class instance. No good to us. So we will use the <code>req.session.id</code> as a hashkey so we can lookup the counter for each particular connected client.</p>
    <h3>Use Sessions</h3>
    <p>To add sessions <code>npm i express-session</code> then use the following config:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const session = require("express-session");
const sessionSettings = {
    secret: "best cohort ever",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
};
app.use(session(sessionSettings));
</code></pre>
    <p>Update your Counter class to keep track of every instance (use a static property).</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">class Counter {
    static lookup = {};

    constructor(id) {
        this.value = 1;
        Counter.lookup[id] = this; // every counter we create is added to the lookup hash map which we can access at Counter.lookup
    }

    inc() {
        this.value += 1;
        return this.value.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Add a middleware function that will run on every request this makes sure new requests have an instance of the counter they can access with their session id:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.use((req, res, next) => {
    Counter.lookup[req.session.id] =
        Counter.lookup[req.session.id] || new Counter(req.session.id);
    next();
});
</code></pre>
    <p>finally in the route return the next value</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get("/counter", (req, res) => {
    res.send(Counter.lookup[req.session.id].inc());
});
</code></pre>
    <p>❓ How can we use this functionality to auth a user only once?</p>
    <p>This is now a more familiar concept to you. Getting a session assigned to you is like 'logging' in. To 'log out' you just remove that counter from the session.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement sessions on your server</li>
      <li>Add <code>/login</code> and <code>/logout</code> routes</li>
      <li>The <code>/login</code> route should be the only route that accepts Basic auth request</li>
      <li>Once a user is authenticated with Basic auth add them to a session</li>
      <li>Update <code>/airports</code> and your other endpoints to only return the airport info if the user is in a session</li>
      <li>If a user is in a session and visit the <code>/logout</code> route this should end their session and they will no longer be able to access <code>/airports</code></li>
      <li>Put your solution on Github and share it with your coach</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Lesson 2 - Token-based Authentication</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how token-based auth can replace sessions</li>
      <li>Encode and Decode JWT tokens</li>
      <li>Recall the structure of a JWT</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The problem with sessions</h2>
    <p>Sessions are great but your clients are now bound to one machine. If I have a cluster of computers managing incoming requests and your session is in the memory of machine 1, I can't bounce you to machine 2 to lighten the load. Often, to get around this problem, a separate caching service such as Redis is used to store all the sessions for your application.</p>
    <p>However, to achieve the same thing as a session (authenticate you once then keep track of you) I could use a token based auth system.</p>
    <h2>JWT</h2>
    <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an open industry standard. They are easy to identify, being 3 strings separated by a <code>.</code></p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <p><code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJtZXNzYWdlIjoiSGVsbG8gZnJvbSBNdWx0aXZlcnNlISJ9.UaobFhVDPjPLdQFpXCkvojm7jxMY-wfyfzo7ORoFI4A</code></p>
    <p>The 3 dots separate the 3 parts of a JWT:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Header</strong> - specifies the type of token and the algorithm used to sign the token</li>
      <li><strong>Payload</strong> - the actual information that we want to transmit</li>
      <li><strong>Signature</strong> - used to verify the token has not been tampered with</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The signature is the key part. It is generated by combining the header with the payload <strong>and a secret only the server knows</strong> and hashing them (the function actually involves slightly more than a normal hash but the principle still stands).</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">HmacSha256(base64Encode(Header) + "." + base64Encode(Payload), secret);
// SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c &#x3C;- that is the Signature part
</code></pre>
    <p>So, let's say that when a user logs in with their password we want them stay logged-in for 30 minutes. We can take their user id and the time in 30 minutes and put that data in a JSON:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">JSON.stringify({ userId: user.id, expires: Date.now() + 30 * 60 * 1000 });
</code></pre>
    <p>That is our payload. We then base64-encode it (and do the same with whatever headers are relevant). We now have the first two parts of the JWT. We then pass these into a HMAC function with our secret. This gives us our signature. We append this to the end of the JWT and send it to the user.</p>
    <p>The user then sends us back this token on their next request. To check that it's valid, we extract the header and payload from the JWT and apply the HMAC function, as before, to the payload, headers and secret. This will give us back a signature and, if the signature matches that on the end of the JWT, we know only we could have created it and so the token is valid. If the user had tampered with the JWT (say, by changing their userId) we would know because the signature would no longer match.</p>

    <h2>Creating and Storing Secrets</h2>
    <p>The security of JWTs relies on the fact that only the server know the secret it uses to sign the token. We therefore need to be careful with how we handle this secret.</p>
    <p>To generate a secret, openssl's <code>rand</code> is useful:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sh">> openssl rand -hex 16
71db048a3af939a4632c3953e5dc1ff5
</code></pre>
    <p>In theory, we could put that secret directly into our source code, however, anyone with access to our git repository would then be able to read it. A better system is to make the secret an <strong>environmental variable</strong>. Environmental variables are variables within a programme which are set from outside the programme. As well as for secrets, they're useful for definining things like the port which a process should run on; the URLs it should make requests to; the mode an application is running in (testing vs development vs production etc.) and so on.</p>
    <p>In Node.js, we can set an environmental variable using a <code>.env</code> file. In this file, we can set our environmental variables like so:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sh">JWT_SECRET=268b38878c05cdeb684b3e69ee28e5411a1cc2d1c0555abbfac9a75dc9332441

PORT=4000
</code></pre>
    <p>To load them, we need to install the <code>dotenv</code> package using npm then call its config method. Our environmental variables are then loaded onto the <code>process.env</code> object:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">require("dotenv").config();

console.log(process.env.JWT_SECRET);
</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Importantly</strong>, we should then add our <code>.env</code> to our <code>.gitignore</code> file to ensure it never gets pushed to our repository. If we push <code>.env</code> by mistake, we should immediately change our key.</p>
    <p>Lots of deployment platforms (Heroku, AWS etc.) also allow you to enter an application's environmental variables on their website. They will then encrypt them on disk and use them when running the application.</p>
