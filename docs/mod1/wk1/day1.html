    <h1>Mod 1 > Week 1 > Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>
      Today we are going to learn about Representational state transfer (REST) and what makes an API RESTful. We covered this topic briefly in
      the Bootcamp but over the next 2 weeks we'll be going into a lot more depth.
      Today we will use <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to call some RESTful APIs and look in detail at the requests we send and responses we receive.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
      <li>Understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS</li>
      <li>Understand the different HTTP methods and which one is appropriate for modelling CRUD operations</li>
      <li>Understand the most common HTTP response codes and how these indicate success or failure in RESTful operations</li>
      <li>Become familiar with using Postman to call RESTful APIs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask apprentices to install <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
    <p>TODO - we need to make this interactive, perhaps use breakout rooms and allocate different APIs for each group to call. Ask them to come back &#x26; present a description of the API / share screen to send request. Challenge could be to used advanced Postman features such as scripts.</p>
    <p>TODO - fun activity could be to find the most obscure HTTP response code (my favourite is "I'm a teapot"). Could do a fun quiz where the answers are status codes!</p>
