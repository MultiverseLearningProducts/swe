    <p>By the end of this module you will have selected a compendium of technologies and libraries that you can use in your final 5 day synoptic project. This is really about putting everything you have learnt on your apprenticeship together and writing software at a professional level.</p>
    <p>We are going to cover the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Selecting a stack</li>
      <li>Data design for schema and schemaless databases</li>
      <li>Testing strategies and environments</li>
      <li>Design systems</li>
      <li>Getting stuck? Getting unstuck!</li>
      <li>Packaging for deployment with Docker</li>
      <li>Making a video demo</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Stacks</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Articulate the differences between a framework and a library</li>
      <li>Demonstrate the knowledge to implement a full stack app with authentication</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h1>Selecting a stack</h1>
    <p>What is a stack?</p>
    <p>A stack refers to a collection of different software products that work together to create an application for the web. For example you may hear developers talk about the <strong>MEAN</strong> stack.</p>
    <h2>MongoDB - Database</h2>
    <h2>Express - Server</h2>
    <h2>Angular - Frontend framework</h2>
    <h2>Node.js - Backend runtime</h2>
    <p>Each of these elements in the stack are designed to be modular. That means they can be used in combination with other technologies and frameworks. For example the <strong>MERN</strong> stack.</p>
    <h2>MongoDB - Database</h2>
    <h2>Express - Server</h2>
    <h2>React - Frontend framework</h2>
    <h2>Node.js - Backend runtime</h2>
    <p>Can you spot the difference? What has been swapped out?</p>
    <h2>The JAM stack</h2>
    <p>Remember you can also combine languages with APIs for example the JAM stack.</p>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <h2>APIs</h2>
    <h2>Markdown</h2>
    <p>The JAM stack side steps the need to run a webserver. Your site can be a set of markdown files parsed into HTML pages (github pages, surge, gatsby etc), enhanced with javascript and use cloud based datastores like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase</a>, or services like <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>. This method leverages cloud based products to remove the burden of writing and running all the services for a full stack app.</p>
    <p>You need to decide on your stack. You will want to be able to create a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud">CRUD</a> app with user accounts.</p>
    <h2>Frameworks vs Libraries</h2>
    <p>This is a famous debate among software developers. There are pros and conns to both.</p>
    <h3>Frameworks</h3>
    <p>An example of a web framework is <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>. These are complete solutions where everything is configured for you. Generally you create a new app and these frameworks scaffold out a project for you.</p>
    <h3>Libraries</h3>
    <p>A library is a non-volatile resource. A module of code compiled together that provides some functionality or service to a programme. An example of a web app using libraries might be a Node.js app build with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Express - web server</li>
      <li>Pug - for templating</li>
      <li>Redis - for the database</li>
      <li>Apprun.js - for frontend javascript interactivity</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>üë©üèæ‚ÄçüíªüßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª</h1>
    <p>In pairs can you think about the pros and conns of frameworks, and the pros and conns of using libraries? Report back to the cohort when you have finished.</p>
    <h2>Today's Assignment</h2>
    <p>Can you decide on a stack that you will use in your synoptic project. Create a new application with your stack and implement user accounts. Be ready to demo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a new user</li>
      <li>Log in as a user</li>
      <li>See a page that displays user data</li>
      <li>Log out</li>
    </ul>
