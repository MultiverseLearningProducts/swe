    <h1>Mod 2 > Week 1 > Day 1</h1>
    <p>Coaches: structure for module, including code samples, etc: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yEXM0tg1xQJzzhAWPbw4rYeg3bF2ixs57pAh2_kE4q4/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>.</p>
    <p>In the fullness of time, the stucture above needs to be turned into a JavaScript course we can enroll students on.</p>
    <p>Mock exams can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s__-ZrkKz3oLw9P26aUe787wCritSIQE?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Some notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some apprentices found the validation practical on day 1 a challenge. Consider moving to later in the week</li>
      <li>The apprentices really enjoyed the bug fixing exercise on day 2</li>
      <li>Consider bringing DOM content earlier in the week (apprentice feedback)</li>
      <li>They seemed to enjoy sketching the DOM</li>
      <li>The GET vs POST must cover things like caching, max query param length, when to use GET/POST</li>
      <li>Offloading the best practice research to the apprenties in groups seemed to work well</li>
      <li>Apprentices reported that our mock questions are "very relevant" to the actual exam</li>
      <li>They really enjoyed doing the Spotify clone app (ask Dan for more info)</li>
      <li>Revision time with ad-hoc mock exams seemed to work well in week 2</li>
    </ul>
