    <p><a href="https://whitehatlearningproducts.github.io/swe/mod3/wk1/day1.html">Mod 3 > Week 1 > Day 1</a></p>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Give the apprentices an overview of the 7 stages of the Software Developement Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>
    <h1>Session 1 - Introduction to the SDLC</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognise that there are several ways to represent the terminology and stages of the SDLC.</li>
      <li>Describe the role of the SDLC in the context of developing of IT systems and services, and operational software end-products.</li>
      <li>Explain the purpose of the SDLC as a means to facilitate the creation of effective software.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>None</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Materials</h2>

    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>In conversation with your apprentices try to help they identify the systems that they are a part of. There is a way their company produces software, can they articulate that?</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In the plenary session get them to recite back the stages</li>
      <li>Can someone recall the stages in reverse?</li>
      <li>Can the group recite each stage in turn?</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Explain why it is important to plan software development.</li>
      <li>Explain the purpose of a business case.</li>
      <li>Describe potential tangible and intangible benefits that can be achieved using operational software, including:
        <ul>
          <li>cost savings</li>
          <li>productivity gains</li>
          <li>risk reduction</li>
          <li>time savings</li>
          <li>increased income</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Demonstrate a simple cost benefit analysis for a given case.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They know the 7 stages of the SDLC</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The cost benefit analysis might be new to some apprentices. Make sure they have correctly understood the formula. I use the prompt "ABC" to remind myself of the sum you have to do; Benefit / Cost, A - B for Benefit, C for cost. They will not be faced with a very complex question about this. Being able to tackle the two exercises will be enough.</p>
    <p>Below are the answers to the return on investment exercises.</p>
    <p>
      ???
      [q] The cost benefit ratio is (rounded to 2 decimal places)
      [ ] 0.97
      [#] 1.07
      ???
    </p>
    <p>
      ???
      [q] Given the cost benefit ratio of the above should you go ahead with the 4th lane?
      [#] YES
      [ ] NO
      ???
    </p>
    <p>
      ???
      [q] Should the CEO hire 2 new programmers?
      [#] YES
      [ ] NO
      ???
    </p>
    <p>
      ???
      [q] What is the cost benefit ratio (rounded to 2 decimal places)?
      [#] 1.24
      [ ] 24.1
      [ ] 0.24
      ???
    </p>
    <p>
      ???
      [q] Who is the feasibility study for?
      [ ] The customers
      [#] The executive team
      [ ] The project managers
      ???
    </p>
    <p>
      ???
      [q] Once the feasibility study has been created what is the next phase of the SDLC?
      [#] Design
      [ ] Development
      [ ] Requirements Engineering
      ???
    </p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make some time to read the assignments on applied. You can leave them feedback. It is important to make the time to do this. Your feedback will encourage engagement during the rest of the module.</li>
    </ul>
