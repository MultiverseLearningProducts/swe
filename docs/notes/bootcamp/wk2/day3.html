    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 2 > Day 3</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we are starting to use our SQL skills in our Node.js code. This is an important step where we start to connect our code to a database.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - SQLite3 installation</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Install SQLite3</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>There is no differentiation in this assignment, all students require sqlite installed. Where necessary, use breakout rooms to allow apprentices to help each other.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Using Node.js to run queries</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How to integrate SQL into Node.js code</li>
      <li>Awareness of SQL injection</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>

    <h2>Lesson 3 - Visualising your database</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a VSCode plugin to view tables</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>There is no differentiation in this assignment, all students require sqlite installed. Where necessary, use breakout rooms to allow apprentices to help each other.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 4 - Loading JSON data into SQLite3 using Node.js</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>In this lesson you will learn how to load your restaurant tables with data from file using Node.js. You will use nested iteration to loop through the data and relate data using foreign keys.</p>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhiteHatLearningProducts/airports/master/airportsData.json">airports.json</a> file from week <em>you can run the following command to download the file into your project folder</em></li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-sh">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhiteHatLearningProducts/airports/master/airportsData.json --output airports.json
</code></pre>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The idea in this session is to load the airport data into the database. Walk through setting up SQLite3 in Node.js. It's a great opportunity to go back over their understanding of async functions and the pending callback stack. Dealing with multiple async functions using the recursive pattern seems to fit here really well. The recursive pattern keeps the call stacks small and is considered a more effective ("How Javascript Works - How Tail Calls Work" Douglas Crockford chpt 18.2).</p>
    <p>In this session we have a really nice dual layer of complexity; we are programming in javascript and executing SQL statements on a database.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Tricky challenge. Make sure you are clear about whats being asked here.</p>
