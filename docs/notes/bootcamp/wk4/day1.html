    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we turn our attention to the Browser. We look firstly at Web Accessibility, a critical part of website development, ensuring that people with disabilities can use the web equally.</p>
    <p>We then discuss the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), HTML DOM Events and how to write JavaScript in the browser.</p>
    <p>Modern web applications are powered by JavaScript. There are lots of popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue that help to organise and support building applications in a browser. We focus on a micro-framework called AppRun which mimics the design of React, Elm and to some degree Vue and Angular.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - Web Accessibility</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objective</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand why accessibility is crucial to enabling everyone to access web content</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>Lower ability</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Higher ability</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>If a student has not been able to complete their restaurant app then they can review another student's code for accessibility</td>
          <td>Read the WCAG standards</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Using JavaScript in the browser</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objective</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the 2 ways to run JavaScript in the browser and when each should be used</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>Lower ability</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Higher ability</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Tell the student it doesn't matter how the website looks as long as the Facebook icon and counter appear somewhere</td>
          <td>Challenge the student to layout the counter/buttons nicely</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Lesson 3 - The HTML Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objective</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what the DOM is</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Make sure you explain the DOM using the diagram provided - you could get the students to create their own digram based on some HTML</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lesson 4 - The HTML DOM Events</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how the <code>event</code> object is 'injected' into event handlers</li>
      <li>Add event listeners to HTML elements</li>
      <li>Create event handlers in JavaScript and attach them to event listeners</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>Lower ability</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Higher ability</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Get the student just to play with the demo Creepy story</td>
          <td>Challenge the student to create a Creepy story with a varierty of event types</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Lesson 5 - Frameworks (Optional)</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a simple "To Do" list using the state, view, update design pattern in AppRun</li>
    </ul>
