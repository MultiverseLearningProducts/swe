    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 5 (Coach Notes)</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Group projects time. Introduce end-to-end testing with Cypress.io</p>
    <h2>Testing your app</h2>
    <p>At this point each group should have an app with some UI. Take one of the projects that is quite well formed i.e. where you can create a project. Fork or clone the repo and set up cypress.io in the project. Be aware Jest and Cypress do clash a bit and require some config to avoid both trying to run <code>.spec.js</code> files. Also you'll want to be able to run the app with an empty in memory database.</p>
    <p>Talk about the value and purpose of end to end testing. Step through creating a test that navigates to a page and creates a project/board. Main API to demonstrate is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>cy.visit</code></li>
      <li><code>cy.get</code></li>
      <li><code>cy.get(el).type("show them from filling")</code></li>
      <li><code>cy.get(el).click()</code></li>
      <li><code>cy.get(el).find(el).contains("the project you just created")</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>They will be blown away by this. Encourage them to have a go at writing even 1 user journey. It's way quicker then manually typing stuff in and clicking around.</p>
    <p>The rest of the day continue in your supporting role.</p>
