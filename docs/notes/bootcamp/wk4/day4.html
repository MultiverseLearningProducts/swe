    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 4 (Coach Notes)</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Group projects time. Your day as coach can be less structured. I might skip the afternoon session for example. I would still bring everyone together for a plenary in the day and then again at the end of the day.</p>
    <h2>Getting organised</h2>
    <p>Get your groups to do a morning standup together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What did they do yesterday</li>
      <li>What is their plan for today</li>
      <li>Any blockers/queries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a group they should articulate where they want to be by the end of the day. What is the milestone they are aiming for as a group? Encourage over communication. I have found groups that communicate make software that works.</p>
    <p>Keep an eye on every group, pair and support. I'd encourage you to limit your coach time to 1 <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">pomodoro</a> (25mins). Then have a break. Don't get sucked into 45min - 1h pairing sessions. Have a break. You can always come back and pair together later.</p>
    <h2>Baby steps</h2>
    <p>There is scope here for informal coach input. You might want to start the afternoon by talking about moving in small steps. Avoiding making too many changes at once. You can talk about what goes into a code review. Maybe comment on issues you have noticed in the group projects.</p>
