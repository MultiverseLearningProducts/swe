    <p><a href="https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/swe/bootcamp/wk1/day1.html">Bootcamp > Week 1 > Day 1</a></p>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Day one enables the cohort to get their computer set up so that they can write JavaScript using Node.js. We introduce the concepts of Arrays, Objects and functions in Javascript.</p>
    <p><strong>Invite the line managers and CSMs to the end of Bootcamp preentation (3-5pm on the last Friday) if you have not done so already!</strong></p>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <p>Installation of the tools specified in 'Setup' section of the course notes will mean the day will run much more smoothly and that Session 1 can be omitted.</p>
    <h1>Session 1 - Setup</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Install the software required for the apprenticeship</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>If the apprentices have not yet setup the tools described in the 'Setup' section of the course notes then set aside 1.5hrs for this to be completed.</p>

    <h1>Session 2 - Objects and functions</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate creating objects in Javascript</li>
      <li>Demonstrate creating functions with the function keyword in Javascript</li>
      <li>Use arrays to organise objects into groups</li>
      <li>Create references to objects inside other objects</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with arrays, how to create them, put items inside them and use indexes to reference items in an array</li>
      <li>using JSON.stringify to console.log a nested object in their shell</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Materials</h2>

    </ul>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Walk them through creation of objects in 3 ways. The third way is more advanced. Basically if you create an object like this <code>Object.create(null)</code> it does not inherit any thing from the prototypal chain, but if you give it another object it will. We visit this again in Mod 2 when talking about prototypal inheritance. Plant the seed now, then move on.</p>
    <p>One really important thing to start doing is introducing the terminology of an object, for example a property, what a key is, what a value is. How to access properties, how to call functions on an object and how you can create structures using objects and arrays.</p>
    <p>Talk about <code>this</code> when you create the <code>childOf</code> function. It's the <code>this</code> of the object to which it belongs.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Be conscious that not all students have a stable family environment hence we suggest they model the Royal Family. Start with the current generation, group the generation together in an array. Have them assign that grouping to a variable.</p>
    <p>Then do the same with the next generation but write the definition above the <code>firstGen</code> variable (because you will not be able to reference some thing that has not been defined yet), and the third generation above the second.</p>
    <p>Then you can start to relate them together. Use a <code>parents</code> property on the person object and in an array make references to the parents in the correct generation array.</p>
    <p>Finally add a <code>childOf</code> function that uses this to reference the parents array of itself. You can also return a cheeky default using the <code>||</code> or operator.</p>
