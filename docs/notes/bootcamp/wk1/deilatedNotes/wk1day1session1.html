    <h1>Setup and Prep for Bootcamp</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Day one is about getting to know your cohort and setting up their computers so they are prepared to start prorgamming.</p>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <p>Apprentices should have familiarity with basic JavaScript concepts, specifically the ones listed below. If helpful, direct apprentices before the lesson to the GitHub page and links they can reference:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp">JavaScript Syntax</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp">JavaScript Data Types</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">JavaScript Variables</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">JavaScript Arrays</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp">JavaScript Array Methods</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp">JavaScript Arrow Functions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-node">An overview of Node</a> - also watch the first 5.30 minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIQgVdoYb0M">An Introduction to Node in Visual Studio Code</a></li>
      <li>There is a great article on the <a href="https://community.multiverse.io/topics/16826/feed">Community Hub</a> which compares statically typed languages (like JavaScript) and dynamically typed languages (like Java) - well worth a read!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They must also be confident using Git to clone, add, commit and push to their Git repository.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Notes: Day 2 Session 2 - Airports</h2>
    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p><a href="#Welcome">back</a></p>
    <h4>5 minutes</h4>
    <p>Welcome apprentices to the first day of bootcamp! Explain what they will be doing over the next 5 weeks and that it will accumulate in a group project and presentation with other coaches and even their line mangers.</p>
    <p>Make sure apprentices understand they will be doing code a longs but the bootcamp is to get them ready for their work placements. These sessions are designed to get them ready but also to give them time to ask questions if they feel unsure. You are the their coach and you are here for them!</p>
    <h3>Ice Breaker</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>20 minutes</h4>
    <p>Take some time to do an ice breaker with your cohort. You may have already done a few before in Flying Start, but it is important to build a sense of community. You can find a few suggestions for games here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yQ9yBPV1BvhzxAKH5nc0zw7tjiBvX8xg?usp=sharing">Ice Breaker Ideas</a></p>
    <p>If you know a great ice breaker feel free to do your own</p>
    <h3>Navigating Resources</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>10 minutes</h4>
    <p>Apprentices will be using GitHub a lot so make sure they know how to navigate to the site. Things you should make sure apprentices know how to use:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>GitHub</li>
      <li>Applied</li>
      <li>Community Hub</li>
      <li>Slack/Communication channel of choice for cohort</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These will be the areas apprentices will work with you and each other the most so it is important to give an overview! If you need more time, take it to cover the basics.</p>
    <h3>Setting Up Your Coding Environment</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>10 minutes</h4>
    <p>Instructions for setting up their computers can be found in <a href="https://whitehatlearningproducts.github.io/swe/bootcamp/wk1/day1.html">Bootcamp > Week 1 > Day 1</a>. Apprentices should have completed these steps before today, but if not walk through the set up with them.</p>
    <h3>Wrap Up</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>5 minutes</h4>
    <p>Before we move on to the afternoon session make sure your computer is set up and ready to go. As well, if you have any questions about accessing the materials let me know.</p>
