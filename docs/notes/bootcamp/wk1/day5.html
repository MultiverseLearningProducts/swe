    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 1 > Day 5</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today is about practicing what has been covered/learnt so far.</p>
    <h1>Session 1 - London Scooter Hire</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate the syntax for defining a class</li>
      <li>Set up Jest tests write unit tests for your classes</li>
      <li>Write Async tests</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pre-work or Assumed knowledge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed version of airports</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This is a variation on the airports exercise. A great time to consolidate what has been covered so far. If you have apprentices who still need to complete the airports exercise, they could focus on that instead.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>You have been asked to create a scooter hire system. Electric scooters need to be charged at scooter charging stations. Users can only hire and unplug a scooter if the battery is fully charged. Users always use up the battery charge, so when a scooter is returned to a charging station, you can expect the battery to be empty. It takes about 12000 milliseconds to charge a scooter (you have to wait, it's async).</p>
    <p>Use test driven development and create the classes and interactions that you feel capture this functionality.</p>
    <p>Things to look for are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how they have designed the async tests?</li>
      <li>are they using state i.e. a "charging" property/flag</li>
      <li>are they thinking about objects like: Station/Dock, Scooter, User</li>
    </ul>
