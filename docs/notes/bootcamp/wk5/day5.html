    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 5 > Day 5 (Coach Notes)</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today is the last day of the bootcamp. We want to finish on a high with each apprentice brimming with confidence and excited about starting their jobs the following Monday.</p>
    <h2>Retrospective</h2>
    <p>In their original teams they should retrospect on their group project. The idea is to gain some insight into their process that will be meaningful and interesting to share with the cohort and line managers.</p>
    <p>Create a <a href="https://jamboard.google.com/d/13noLs_rzJHmmWtgEr1SbpKg6UI7Hu1KP7HNysoIlbuc/viewer?f=1">Jam Board</a> like this:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">ðŸ˜€</th>
          <th align="left">ðŸ˜–</th>
          <th align="left">ðŸ¤”</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td align="left">in this column go things they felt went really well that they loved</td>
          <td align="left">in this column the pain points or things that made them cross or frustrated</td>
          <td align="left">in this column put things they are still puzzled by or want to know more about</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Once all the sticky notes are created and the group have exhausted themselves. Bring them back.</p>
    <p>Next give them each 5 votes. They can spend their 5 votes on any single sticky note or combination of sticky notes. The 3 sticky notes with the most votes the group should reflect on more deeply and try to draw out some conclusions. For example;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>after this project what will they do differently next time?</li>
      <li>what behaviors contributed to their team working well || badly?</li>
      <li>what advice would they give the next cohort?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>Having retrospected the groups should plan their presentation. We are mostly interested in the process of collaborating on a code base and how they found that. Demo the app and tell everyone about what you learned in the process.</p>
    <p>Individuals also need some time to plan what they are going to say as they demo their individual features.</p>
    <h2>Showcase</h2>
    <p>This usually takes a couple of hours, invite the line managers and other stakeholders to the event. You are the host/MC introduce the bootcamp, the final group projects and then the individual projects. Close the event off will a bang and send your apprentices off into their workforce on a high. <em>Remember they still need to fill in their attendance log for the day!</em></p>
