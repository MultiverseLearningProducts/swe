    <h3>Advice</h3>
    <p><a href="#Welcome">back</a></p>
    <h4>20 minutes</h4>
    <p>For coaches, this is one of the last oppurtunties to give advice to your apprenitces. They will not be able to directly ask you for help on their project, so give some parting advice to guide them. You can use the advice presented on GitHub as a base, but feel free to add your own. You know you apprentices and where they are struggling or where they are doing well so guide them.</p>
    <h3>Q and A</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>20 minutes</h4>
    <p>Open the floor for a Q and A. How do apprentices feel about their projects? Are they having issues that need troubleshooting? Set some time aside to talk about this. If questions are not coming, split apprentices into groups and have them share where they are at in their projects together.</p>
