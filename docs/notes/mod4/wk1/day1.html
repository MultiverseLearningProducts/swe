    <h2>Overview of module</h2>
    <p>Module 4 uses a mixture of on-the-job training and a two-week bootcamp to get apprentices to EPA-readiness for the 5-day synoptic project that forms part of the Apprenticeship EPA. Through completing two individual projects, apprentices will be prepared for the demands of the EPA synoptic project.Overview of day</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what the requirments for the EPA synoptic project</li>
      <li>Understand the pros and cons of different stacks</li>
      <li>Understand the pros and cons of frameworks and libraries</li>
      <li>Be able to articulate reasoning for choices made for app development (stacks/ frameworks/ libraries)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Thinking of the synoptic project, decide on a stack that you will use. Create a new application with your stack and implement user accounts. Be ready to demo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a new user</li>
      <li>Log in as a user</li>
      <li>See a page that displays user data</li>
      <li>Log out</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p><a href="#Welcome">back</a></p>
    <h4>10 minutes</h4>
    <p>Welcome apprentices to module 4. Let them know that in this module it is all about getting them EPA ready for the final synoptic project.</p>
    <p>By the end of this module you will have selected a compendium of technologies and libraries that you can use in your final 5 day synoptic project. This is really about putting everything you have learnt on your apprenticeship together and writing software at a professional level.</p>
    <p>We are going to cover the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Selecting a stack</li>
      <li>Data design for schema and schemaless databases</li>
      <li>Testing strategies and environments</li>
      <li>Design systems</li>
      <li>Getting stuck? Getting unstuck!</li>
      <li>Making a video demo</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Selecting a stack</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>20 minutes</h4>
    <p>Guide apprentices to understand the pros and cons of different stacks. Go over MEAN, MERN, and JAM stacks. In particular, provide examples of when one stack may be more beneficial than others and why.</p>
    <p>Have apprentices share their experience so far with selecting a stack and see if they can articulate they "why" ofr their choices. If you notice apprentices do not want to talk much, split them into pairs or small groups.</p>
    <h3>Frameworks vs Libraries</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>30 minutes</h4>
    <p>Similar to the stacks conversation, guide apprentices to understand the pros and cons for frameworks and stacks. Like with stacks, making a choice is the first step, articulating the "why" is the next.</p>
    <h4>Check for understanding:</h4>
    <p>In pairs can you think about the pros and conns of frameworks, and the pros and conns of using libraries? Report back to the cohort when you have finished. You will have 10 minutes</p>
    <h3>On Your Own</h3>
    <p><a href="#Overview">back</a></p>
    <h4>5 minutes</h4>
    <p>Can you decide on a stack that you will use in your synoptic project. Create a new application with your stack and implement user accounts. Be ready to demo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a new user</li>
      <li>Log in as a user</li>
      <li>See a page that displays user data</li>
      <li>Log out</li>
    </ul>
