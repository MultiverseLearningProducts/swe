    <h2>Lesson 1 - Web Workers</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>2.5 Create a web worker process Start and stop a web worker; pass data to a web worker; configure timeouts and intervals on the web worker; register an event listener for the web worker; limitations of a web worker</em></li>
      <li><em>1.3 Apply styling to HTML elements programmatically Change the location of an element; apply a transform; show and hide elements</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>For our audio app to work we need something in our programme that acts like a beating heart or a ticking clock. This tick will move the playhead from bar to bar and enable us to trigger the playing of notes from our audio grid.</p>
    <p>As you can imagine it will be important that our beat is even and steady. We don’t want the regular ticking to be screwed by other demands on the javascript execution thread that might be made, by animations for example. This is a good case for a WebWorker</p>
    <h2>What is a WebWorker?</h2>
    <p>A WebWorker is a separate process that we can run in the browser.</p>
    <h2>Setting up the audio engine’s tick</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a WebWorker when the application loads in the browser</li>
      <li>Wire up a start message that is sent when the play button is pressed</li>
      <li>Upon receiving the start message your WebWorker should send messages on a steady beat</li>
      <li>When the stop button is pressed you should stop the regular “tick” messages coming from the WebWorker</li>
      <li>You should also terminate the WebWorker when the page unloads</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Moving the bar</h2>
    <p>Use this beating heart to move the bar across the grid. Something like this.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/71742206-e1e36f80-2e58-11ea-84da-70b028c93d5a.gif" alt="bar looping">
    </p>
    <p>We have a Note class in our app. All these notes that we have really need organising. We want to be able to "play" whats on the grid and "record" our track. There is enough functionality needed for us to create a Grid class that will organise and keep track of the bars, and beats.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">class Grid {
	constructor() {
	  this.worker = new Worker("/worker.js")
	  this.bar = 0
	  this.grid = [
	    [1047.0, 1175, 1319, 1397, 1480, 1568, 1760, 1976],
	    [523.3, 587.3, 659.3, 698.5, 740, 784, 880, 987.8],
	    [261.6, 293.7, 329.6, 349.2, 370, 392, 440, 493.9],
	    [130.8, 146.8, 164.8, 174.6, 185, 196, 220, 246.9]
		].map(row => row.map(freq => new Note(freq)))
		this.worker.onmessage = this._tick.bind(this)
	}
	play() {
	  this.worker.postMessage("start")
	}
	stop() {
	  this.worker.postMessage("stop")
	  this.grid.forEach(row => row.forEach(note => {
		note.selected = false
		note.renderSelected()
	  }))
	  this.bar = 0
	}
	_tick() {
	  this._play()
	  this.bar = this.bar === 7 ? 0 : this.bar + 1
	}
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Now we have some updates to make to our Notes class (but we will come back to that). Lets go through this class. In the constructor function we set up some state, the worker, the bar and the grid.</p>
    <p>Can you see how we set up the web worker? The grid starts off as a multi-dimensional array. Then we map over it returning an array of arrays of notes set to a particular frequency.</p>
    <p>Finally we set an event listener on the worker that will call <code>this._tick</code> when it receives messages. Notice we are doing the same thing as we did earlier, using bind to bind the context of the class to <code>this._tick</code>.</p>
    <p><code>this.play</code> sends a "start" message to the web worker, <code>this.stop</code> sends a "stop" message to the worker, but also re-sets the bar and grid. <code>this._tick</code> is called whenever we receive a message from the worker, and it increments the bar, and calls a function that we have not created yet called <code>this._play</code>. We will come back to that.</p>
    <h3>Worker</h3>
    <p>The web worker just sends messages at regular intervals.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">let interval;
onmessage = function (msg) {
    if(msg.data === "start") {
        interval = setInterval(() => {
            postMessage("tick")
        }, 300)
    }
    if(msg.data === "stop") {
        clearInterval(interval)
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>In this file the meaning of <code>this</code> is the web worker itself. So when we reference <code>onmessage</code> and <code>postMessage</code> javascript looks in the local scope for definitions of these methods. They are not in the local scope, so javascript goes up one level to the parent scope (the worker) and finds that these methods are defined in that scope. <code>clearInterval</code> is defined in the global scope (the window object).</p>
    <p>We could also write the same method like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">let interval;
this.onmessage = function (msg) {
    if(msg.data === "start") {
        interval = setInterval(() => {
            this.postMessage("tick")
        }, 300)
    }
    if(msg.data === "stop") {
        clearInterval(interval)
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Now we have a beat. Can you console log out the bar progressing from 0 - 7?</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const grid = new Grid()
</code></pre>
    <p>Add the call to <code>new Grid()</code> to your javascript file and see if you can start and stop a regular beat coming into your app from the web worker. You will have to wire up your control buttons to call <code>grid.start</code> on click:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;button onclick="grid.start()">Start&#x3C;/button>
</code></pre>
    <h3>Note UI</h3>
    <p>We need to update our <code>Note</code> class to have a method we can call that will temporary give the note a highlight when the bar is being played. Add the following to your <code>Note</code> class:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">highlight() {
    this.el.addClass("highlight")
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.el.removeClass("highlight")
    }, 300)
    return this
}
</code></pre>
    <h3><code>Grid._play()</code></h3>
    <p>We need to create that <code>_play()</code> method mentioned earlier and add it to the <code>Grid</code> class.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">_play() {
    this.grid
        .map(row => row[this.bar])
        .flat()
        .map(note => note.highlight())
}
</code></pre>
    <p>In the <code>_play</code> method above we map over the rows that form the grid and return only the note that corresponds to the current bar. That leaves us with a structure that would look something like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">[
  [Note],
  [Note],
  [Note],
  [Note]
]
</code></pre>
    <p>Calling <code>.flat()</code> on this structure will remove the nesting and flatten the array to this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">[Note, Note, Note, Note]
</code></pre>
    <p>Next we map over each Note instance and call <code>note.highlight()</code> on each one.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Why do you think it is important to return <code>this</code> from the <code>.highlight</code> method?</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Web Audio API</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>1.5 Establish the scope of objects and variables Define the lifetime of variables; keep objects out of the global namespace; use the "this" keyword to reference an object that fired an event; scope variables locally and globally</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h1>WebAudio API and Inheritance</h1>
    <p>We have frequencies. Now it is time to use them. Each instance of a Note has its own frequency. We can use the browser's built in Web Audio API to play those frequencies.</p>
    <p>One important thing to know about the Web Audio API is that before initialising the <code>AudioContext</code> and playing a frequency, there must be an interaction by the user, either a gesture or a click event. This is to prevent the Web Audio API starting on page load and starting to emit sound that the user has no control over.</p>
    <p>We also want only 1 instance of the <code>AudioContext</code> on our page but many instances of oscillators at different frequencies. Lets solve this using inheritance.</p>
    <h2>Playing notes</h2>
    <p>Here is how to play a simple note (you can paste this into your browsers console to hear it).</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const context = new AudioContext()
const o = context.createOscillator()
o.frequency.value = 4400
o.connect(context.destination)
o.start()
o.stop(context.currentTime + 1)
</code></pre>
    <p>You can think of a note as an object. We’ll want to create lots of notes in our programme, they will all be similar, but might have different frequencies and start at different times. This is a good candidate for using classes.</p>
    <p>Each note will rely on the audio context. We only need one of these, all the notes we create will originate from and be connected to this context. The frequency of an individual note only need to exist in the scope of an instance of a note.</p>
    <p>What we need is a singular context object, and then note objects that inherit access to that audio context. We want to end up making new notes like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">new Note(4400)
</code></pre>
    <p>The Note class needs to have access to the audio context. But we also want to have the audio context kept out of global scope. It is best practice to keep variables out of global scope. In global scope variables can be read by any part of your program, and variables can be reassigned by any code in the program.</p>
    <p>Another issue is you can only create a new AudioContext after a user has interacted with the page. You’ll see errors in the console if you try to do this. Because of this lets define our base class MyAppAudio like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">class MyAppAudio {
  static context = undefined;
  static setContext = () => {
    this.context = new AudioContext()
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>The static keyword creates a class property and a class function. It means we can access them without creating an instance with the <strong>new</strong> keyword. This keeps the AudioContext out of global scope and contains it in a class. We can then extend this class with our Note class and then access the context via inheritance.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">class Note extends MyAppAudio {
  constructor(freq) {
    super()
    if (!this.constructor.context) this.constructor.setContext()
    const o = this.constructor.context.createOscillator()
    o.frequency.value = freq
    o.connect(this.constructor.context.destination)
    o.start()
    o.stop(this.constructor.context.currentTime + 1)
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Notice the call <code>super()</code>? We need that in out constructor when we are inheriting from classes. Can you also spot how we reference the inherited <code>context</code> property? Then we need a little guard clause before we create a note to initialise the <code>new AudioContext</code> if it is the first interaction.</p>
    <p>in the example above we used the <strong>class</strong> keyword. This is just syntactic sugar for the javascript prototypal inheritance that is going on behind the scenes. Have a look through the example below that does the same thing only this time using the prototype property.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function AppAudio () {}
AppAudio.prototype.context = undefined
AppAudio.prototype.setContext = function() {
	this.context = new AudioContext()
}

const Note = function (freq) {
	if (!this.constructor.context) this.constructor.setContext()
	const o = this.constructor.context.createOscillator()
	o.frequency.value = freq
	o.connect(this.constructor.context.destination)
	o.start()
	o.stop(this.constructor.context.currentTime + 1)
}
Note.prototype = Object.create(new AppAudio())

function play (freq) {
	new Note(freq)
}
</code></pre>

    </p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Considering the above can you update your Note class to inherit from a Base class called <code>MyAppAudio</code>?</p>
