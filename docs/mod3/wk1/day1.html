    </p>
    <h1>Exam overview</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this exam is to ensure that apprentices are able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of Software Development Methodologies as required by the <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/software-developer-v1-0">IfATE standards</a>, specifically:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand and operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle.</li>
      <li>
        Understand the similarities and differences (taking into account the positives and
        negatives of both approaches) between agile and waterfall software development
        methodologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand how teams work effectively to produce software and contribute
        appropriately.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Exam format</h2>
    <p>The exam consists of 40 multiple-choice question which must be completed within 1 hour. The pass mark is 26/40 (65%).</p>
    <p>The exam is currently taken remotely and you are required to install specific software on your computer to allow remote invigitation.</p>
    <p>The exam marks are split as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>50% of the marks are awarded for knowledge of the role and function of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)</li>
      <li>20% of the marks are awarded for knowledge of Software Development Methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall</li>
      <li>30% of the markes are awarded for knowledge of the Roles and Responsibilities within a software team</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exam pre-requisites</h2>
    <ul>

    <h1>Lesson 1 - The SDLC</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain the role and function of the software development lifecycle</li>
      <li>Relate the seven generic stages of the software development lifecycle</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Purpose of the SDLC</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the SDLC is to specify a set of steps to create a software end-product. It guides us in turning business requirements into operational IT systems.</p>
    <p>The 7 stages of the SDLC are listed below.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/141534650-df8dcfe7-59a1-4f92-8097-40a2fee02923.png" alt="SDLC stages">
    </p>
    <p>Note that you will see variations of these terms on-line and in literature however these are the terms used by the BCS hence we will use these throughout this module.</p>
    <p>The high level purpose of each stage is described below, we will discuss each stage in detail in future lessons.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 2 - Feasibility Study stage</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain how software development is initiated when a need or an opportunity is identified.</li>
      <li>Describe the purpose and main activities of a feasibility study.</li>
      <li>Explain why it is important to plan software development.</li>
      <li>Explain the purpose of a business case.</li>
      <li>Describe potential tangible and intangible benefits that can be achieved using operational software, including:
        <ul>
          <li>cost savings</li>
          <li>productivity gains</li>
          <li>risk reduction</li>
          <li>time savings</li>
          <li>increased income</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Demonstrate a simple cost benefit analysis for a given case.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Purpose of a Feasibility Study</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A feasibility study involves investigation and research to evaluate a project's potential for success.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The idea for a project can come from a number of different places.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Market forces from competitors</li>
      <li>New technologies</li>
      <li>Changes in regulations</li>
      <li>Identifying a gap in the market</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, modern banking apps like Monzo and Starling introduced the ability to freeze a debit card via an app. Other banks saw this and reacted to the competition by implementing this same feature for their own customers. This is an example of a SDLC being driven by business needs.</p>
    <p>Listen to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf4zNLxJZnY">Dragon's Den pitch</a> - do you think the idea is feasible?</p>
    <h2>Creating a Feasibility Study</h2>
    <p>A feasibility study considers the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Business feasibility
        <ul>
          <li>can we get the project out ahead of our competitors?</li>
          <li>does the project fit with our organisational culture/goals?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Technical feasibility
        <ul>
          <li>do we have suitably skilled developers?</li>
          <li>do we have infrastructure to support the rollout?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Financial feasibility
        <ul>
          <li>can the project be done within budget?</li>
          <li>will there be an acceptable return on investment?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cost Benefit Analysis / Return on Investment</h3>
    <p>The financial feasibility is determined based on whether the benefits outweigh the costs of delivery.</p>
    <p>Costs and benefits can be either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Tangible</em> - these are provable in advance e.g. cost savings</li>
      <li><em>Non-tangible</em> - these cannot be proven in advance and are harder to measure e.g. increase in staff morale</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>Cost Benefit Analysis</em> takes into account the non-tangible benefits,
      <em>Return on Investment (ROI)</em> only takes into account tangible benefits.
    </p>
    <p>Cost-benefit is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Cost-benefit = Benefit - Cost</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Cost-benefit <em>ratio</em> is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Cost-benefit = Benefits / Cost</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If a project has a cost-benefit ratio greater than 1.0, the project is generally expected to deliver value.</p>
    <p>Let's look at an example:</p>
    <p>A new lane on the M4 is to be constructed. The costs and benefits of this road are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>£6 million benefit in reduction in accidents</li>
      <li>£11 million benefit in time-savings</li>
      <li>£3.8 million cost in materials costs</li>
      <li>£3.2 million cost in labour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>❓ What is the cost benefit</p>
    <p>❓ What is the cost benefit ratio (rounded to 2 decimal places)?</p>
    <p>Based on this, should the road go ahead?</p>
    <p>Now, read a real live example of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-benefit-analysis-health-economic-studies#example-the-ethan-initiative">Emergency Telehealth and Navigation programme cost benefit analysis</a></p>
    <h2>Business Case</h2>
    <p>A Business Case document is created after the Feasibility Study and provides the justification for undertaking the project. It typically consists of the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Management Summary</li>
      <li>Background</li>
      <li>Options and alternatives considered</li>
      <li>Benefits</li>
      <li>Costs</li>
      <li>Impacts</li>
      <li>Risks</li>
      <li>Conclusion &#x26; recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Choose one of the following Feasibility Studies to review (no need to read it all, just the Executive Summary and table of contents)</p>
