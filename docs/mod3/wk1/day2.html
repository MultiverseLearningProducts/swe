    <h1>Mod 3 > Week 1 > Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - Requirements Analysis</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Distinguish the role of the customer and the user in defining requirements.</li>
      <li>Describe how user research can facilitate understanding of the customer and enduser; who they are; the problem they are faced with; and how they are currently dealing with the problem, including questionnaires; user interviews; contextual enquiry; focus groups; personas; customer journey mapping.</li>
      <li>Explain the difference between functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
      <li>Distinguish non-functional requirements, including:
        <ul>
          <li>security</li>
          <li>availability</li>
          <li>reliability</li>
          <li>performance</li>
          <li>capacity</li>
          <li>continuity</li>
          <li>supportability</li>
          <li>maintainability</li>
          <li>scalability</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Recognise common ways in which software requirements can be expressed.</li>
      <li>Describe the qualities of good requirements and the impact of poor requirements.</li>
      <li>Explain how a data dictionary / glossary of terms can be used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hmRdZZZ6KMa5i9hFEJTnAUYi5XwEBOMHzR8Uc2JLptU/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h1>The Input</h1>
    <p>The input for this stage of the SDLC are the business needs recommended in the feasibility Study. This stage of the SDLC is about working out exactly what needs to be build or purchased in order to deliver the business impacts and benefits defined in the feasibility study.</p>
    <p>There are a number of roles in this stage that we should be familiar with.</p>
    <p>Usually we think about customers as external to an organisation. For example when we buy something from JD sports, we are the customer. However in the roles above you can think of the <strong>Project Sponsor</strong> as a customer. They will ultimately receive the final product, but they may not use the product themselves, the team or their workers may end up using the product.</p>
    <h3>Elicitation</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Requirements are not just waiting to be picked from people like apples from a tree. They have to be mined like tin or iron.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>“Developing Information Systems” by James Cadle</p>
    <p>It’s the <strong>Business Analysts</strong> that will go into an organisation and mine for requirements. How do they do this?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviews</li>
      <li>Focus groups</li>
      <li>Workshops</li>
      <li>Observations</li>
      <li>Shadowing</li>
      <li>Scenarios</li>
      <li>Prototyping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the above methods involve talking to people. There is also another approach that is more data driven.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Questionnaires</li>
      <li>Document analysis</li>
      <li>Record searching</li>
      <li>Activity sampling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example a business analysts might look at a user inputing data in a form and ask what are the current input fields in this form? Why these fields? Where is the input data used? or analysis screen grabs and dissect components. They might also want to know things like how many invoices are filed in a month? How many automated emails sent? When is the system at capacity? Volumetric information like this can help the analysis.</p>
    <h3>Activity sampling</h3>
    <p>To perform <strong>“Activity sampling”</strong> you do the following: At different times (to generate a fair sample) visit a location or office floor and record what each person is doing. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>person1: Responding to emails</li>
      <li>person2: In a meeting</li>
      <li>person3: Tea break</li>
      <li>person4: Working on a feature</li>
      <li>person5: Standup</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The set of activity samples when considered together can help provide an impression of what members of the organisation are doing during working hours.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>In your own words can you explain the difference between the Project Sponsor and the Users?</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Function vs Non-Functional</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h3>The Output</h3>
    <p>The output of this stage is a requirements document. There are various forms this document might take. Below is a break down of the main 4.</p>
    <h3>What makes a “Good” requirement</h3>
    <p>There is quite an art to form a good requirement. Below are the main qualities your requirement must have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Atomic</li>
      <li>Uniquely identified</li>
      <li>Complete</li>
      <li>Consistent and unambiguous</li>
      <li>Traceable</li>
      <li>Prioritised</li>
      <li>Testable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this table you can see examples of bad verses good requirements.</p>
    <p>Students will be able to enrol to post-graduate courses.</p>
    <h2>Requirements Document</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>Typically you would find the sections listed above in a requirements document.</p>
    <h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
    <p>A glossary of terms is a dictionary of acronyms or domain specific words that need defining.</p>
    <h3>Functional Models</h3>
    <p>Functional models are often a way to illustrate or explain how a system needs to work. Functional Decomposition is the process of breaking down that complexity into smaller functions. Below is an example from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/centerofmissingpeople">sites.google.com/site/centerofmissingpeople</a> of functional decomposition.</p>

    </p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>In your own words can you identify a functional and non-functional component of the software you have worked on.</p>
