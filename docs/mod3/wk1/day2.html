    <h3>Inputs to the Requirements Analysis stage</h3>
    <p>The input for this stage of the SDLC are the business needs recommended in the Feasibility Study.</p>
    <h3>Purpose of the Requirements Analysis stage</h3>
    <p>This stage of the SDLC is about working out exactly what needs to be built or purchased in order to deliver the business impacts and benefits defined in the Feasibility Study.</p>
    <h3>Who is involved</h3>
    <p>There are a number of roles involved this stage that we should be familiar with.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>Role</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Responsibility</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Project Sponsor (customer)</td>
          <td>Owns the project and is accountable to the organisation for delivery of business benefits (feasibility study). Controls the scope of the project</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Managers</td>
          <td>Own specific requirements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Users</td>
          <td>People who use the current system and will use the new system. Important they they buy into the new solution</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Domain Experts</td>
          <td>Experience in working in the domain</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Project Manager</td>
          <td>Responsible for development and deliverable to the Project Sponsor</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Business Analysts</td>
          <td>Elicit, document and analyse requirements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Testers</td>
          <td>Help validate that requirements are testable</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Developers</td>
          <td>Help validate that requirements are clearly defined</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Usually we think about customers as external to an organisation. For example when we buy something from JD sports, we are the customer. However in the roles above you can think of the <em>Project Sponsor</em> as a customer. They will ultimately receive the final product even though they may not use the product themselves, their team may end up using the product.</p>
    <h3>Capturing requirements</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Requirements are not just waiting to be picked from people like apples from a tree. They have to be mined like tin or iron" <em>Developing Information Systems by James Cadle</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Itâ€™s the <em>Business Analysts</em> that will go into an organisation and mine for requirements. How do they do this?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviews</li>
      <li>Focus groups</li>
      <li>Workshops</li>
      <li>Observations</li>
      <li>Shadowing</li>
      <li>Scenarios</li>
      <li>Prototyping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a Business Analyst might look at a user inputting data in a form and ask questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what are the current input fields in this form?</li>
      <li>why these fields?</li>
      <li>
        where is the input data used?
        They might also want to know quantitive things like:
      </li>
      <li>how many invoices are filed in a month?</li>
      <li>how many automated emails sent?</li>
      <li>when is the system at capacity?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the methods described above involve talking to people. There are also others approaches that are more data driven.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Questionnaires</li>
      <li>Document analysis</li>
      <li>Record searching</li>
      <li>Activity sampling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an example, imagine you are a Business Analyst working on a project to automate manual processes in a leisure centre. You could use activity sampling to understand what those manual processes were. By visiting the leisure centre at different times (to generate a fair sample) and recording what the receptionist is doing you gather your requirements. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>responding to phone calls</li>
      <li>booking a swimming course</li>
      <li>having a tea break</li>
      <li>looking for lost property</li>
      <li>giving change for the car park</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Categories of requirements</h3>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvIvnfsaFYw" width="776" height="467" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>Requirements analysis elicits both functional and non-functional requirements.</p>
    <p>Functional requirements describe <em>how</em> a system should work</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>ID</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Priority</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>FR1</td>
          <td>MUST</td>
          <td>Menu options include vegetarian, vegan and calorie controlled choices</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FR2</td>
          <td>MUST</td>
          <td>Allergen information is displayed against each ingredient</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FR3</td>
          <td>MUST</td>
          <td>The password reset email contains a unique link which expires after one hour</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FR4</td>
          <td>SHOULD</td>
          <td>Payment options include ApplePay</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Non-functional requirements describe the <em>constraints</em> on the system such as system availability, conformance to security standards etc. Some examples are listed below but take time to study a more complete list on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement">Wikipedia</a></p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>ID</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Priority</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>NFR1</td>
          <td>MUST</td>
          <td>The home page loads in less than 2 seconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NFR2</td>
          <td>MUST</td>
          <td>The system supports up to 1000 concurrent users</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NFR3</td>
          <td>MUST</td>
          <td>Data is held in a Postgres database</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Requirements can also be categorised further into:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>Category</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Business requirements</td>
          <td>General requirements high-level statements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Stakeholder requirements</td>
          <td>Statements for the needs of individuals</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Solution requirements</td>
          <td>Detailed technical requirements (i.e. database must handle 2,000 concurrent connections)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Transition requirements</td>
          <td>What is required to go from state A to state B (training, recruitment, processes, re-structuring)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>What makes a good requirement</h3>
    <p>There is quite an art to form a good requirement. Below are the main qualities your requirement must have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique and atomic (focusses on one thing)</li>
      <li>Complete</li>
      <li>Consistent and unambiguous</li>
      <li>Traceable</li>
      <li>Prioritised</li>
      <li>Testable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's look at some examples of good and poor requirements in terms of how "complete" and "unambiguous" they are:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><strong>Poor</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Good</strong></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>The system must be useable</td>
          <td>The system must conform to the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielson Top 10 Usability Heuristics</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The system must be well tested</td>
          <td>All code must have 80% test coverage</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK - Imagine you are creating a food delivery service called "SOFresh". Create a set of functional and non-functional requirements to express the requirements for the site. Use the ones above as a starting point.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Expressing requirements</h3>
    <p><em>Functional decomposition</em> is the analysis of complex systems/requirements by breaking them down into smaller, simpler elements.</p>
    <p>Requirements can be expressed in a number of different forms including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/centerofmissingpeople/_/rsrc/1480218719774/decomposition-diagram/Functional%20decomposition.png">Functional Decomposition diagrams</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>UML Use Case</em> diagrams which show the interactions between the Actors and the system</p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/141853327-9226b72b-71d2-49c3-af37-ca6879c05297.png" alt="So Fresh simple Use Case diagram">
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>UML Activity</em> diagrams which show how activities are co-ordinated</p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/141858901-75fae65d-d564-41a8-980a-d2ec312f56c8.png" alt="Activity diagram">
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Personas</em> - ficticious characters which represent the different types of actors that will use a product

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>User Stories</em> which describe a feature from the perspective of the end user
          
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/141854008-95a7e86a-7565-41e2-89a4-33228987669e.PNG" alt="userStories">
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Outputs from the Requirements Analysis stage</h3>
    <p>The output of this stage is a requirements document.</p>
    <p>A requirements document should include a <em>Glossary of Terms</em> which explains acronyms or domain specific words used within the document.</p>
    <p>It should also include a <em>Data Dictionary</em> which lists data requirements in such a way that in the Design phase it will be easy able to design a relational database or data structure. Here is an <a href="https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/DD/aerial_single_frame.html">example Data Dictionary</a></p>
    <p>Here are some examples of real requirements documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
