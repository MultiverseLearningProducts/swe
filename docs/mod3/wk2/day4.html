    <h3>The role of the Project Manager</h3>
    <p>The project management life cycle is usually broken down into four phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>initiation</li>
      <li>planning</li>
      <li>execution</li>
      <li>closure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>Project Manager</em> is responsible for the project's scope, budget, team and resources. They are ultimately accountable for the success or failure of the project.</p>
    <h2>Project versus Programme</h2>
    <p>PRINCE2 is a project management method. PRINCE2 defines a <em>project</em> as 'a temporary organisation that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to a specified business case'.</p>
    <p>It also defines a <em>programme</em> as a 'group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually'.</p>
    <h2>Service Management</h2>
    <p>Service Management ensures that an organisation can efficiently implement, deliver, management, and support IT services e.g.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>monitoring against SLAs</li>
      <li>change management</li>
      <li>incident management</li>
      <li>asset management</li>
      <li>service requests e.g. password changes</li>
      <li>disaster recovery</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Operations Management</h2>
    <p>Operations Management manages all the components of an organisation's IT infrastructure e.g.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>network operations</li>
      <li>provisioning of hardware</li>
      <li>backups</li>
    </ul>
