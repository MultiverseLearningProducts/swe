    <h3>The role of the Project Manager</h3>
    <p>The project management life cycle is usually broken down into four phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>initiation</li>
      <li>planning</li>
      <li>execution</li>
      <li>closure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>Project Manager</em> is responsible for the project's scope, budget, team and resources. They are ultimately accountable for the success or failure of the project.</p>
    <h3>Project Manager versus Scrum Master</h3>
    <p>A Scrum Master is NOT the same as a Project Manager.</p>
    <p>A Scrum Master:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coaches team on SCRUM principles</li>
      <li>Facilitates the Daily Scrum (standup)</li>
      <li>Removes blockers that are hindering team members</li>
      <li>Ensures good communication between the team members</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A Scrum Master does NOT manage budgets or project scope.</p>
    <h3>Product Owners versus Scrum Master</h3>
    <p>The Product Owner liaises with the Customer / other stakeholders to understand their needs and then plans and prioritises work for the SCRUM team.</p>
    <h2>What is a Stakeholder</h2>
    <p>A Stakeholder refers to someone who is directly or indirectly affected by the outcome of a project.</p>
    <h2>Project versus Programme</h2>
    <p>PRINCE2 is a project management method. PRINCE2 defines a <em>project</em> as 'a temporary organisation that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to a specified business case'.</p>
    <p>It also defines a <em>programme</em> as a 'group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually'.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK</em> - find job adverts for Project Manager and Programme Manager jobs. Read the job descriptions. Which job role has more responsibility?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>IT Service Management (ITSM)</h2>
    <p>Service Management ensures that an organisation can efficiently implement, deliver, management, and support IT services. It is end-user focussed. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>monitoring against SLAs</li>
      <li>change management - co-ordinating changes to infrastructure and systems</li>
      <li>running an IT Helpdesk</li>
      <li>incident management - responding to service disruption</li>
      <li>asset management - recording &#x26; managing hardware and software assets</li>
      <li>handling service requests - e.g. software upgrade requests, password changes</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK</em> - find job adverts for an 'IT Service Manager'. What does their job description involve? What kind of experience does the individual need? What salary can they expect?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>IT Operations Management (ITOM)</h2>
    <p>Operations Management manages all the components of an organisation's IT infrastructure and executes routine tasks required to support the operation of applications and services. It is internally focussed. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>installing networks</li>
      <li>securing systems</li>
      <li>installation of hardware</li>
      <li>performing upgrades</li>
      <li>performing backups</li>
      <li>monitoring of performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Research how software teams are organised in companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Spotify. Are they functional, cross-functional (matrix) or project based teams? What is the reporting hierarchy?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Update your portfolio to describe the roles in your software development team and the reporting hierarchy.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
