    <h1>Mod 1 > Week 2 > Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we look at the Implementation (Deployment) stage of the SDLC.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the activities undertaken during release and deployment of an IT service, including implementation planning; training users and operations; user documentation; build software release; deploy software.</li>
      <li>Explain how configuration management techniques are used to control and manage the different software development artefacts through the stages of the SDLC and into live operation.</li>
      <li>Explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of 'phased deployment' versus 'big bang' deployment of software.</li>
      <li>Relate phased deployment and big bang deployment to waterfall and agile methods of development.</li>
      <li>Explain the role of software developers in ‘early life support’ for operational software.</li>
      <li>Explain the concepts of ‘release packages’; alpha and beta releases; major and minor releases; software upgrades.</li>
      <li>Produce an appropriate version numbering system for software releases in a given case.</li>
      <li>Explain the concept of software licensing, and describe the types of licence that can be deployed, including proprietary licence; end-user licence; enterprise licence; site licence; workstation licence; perpetual licence; open-source licence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h2>Inputs to the Implementation stage</h2>
    <p>The input to this phase is tested software.</p>
    <h2>Purpose of Implementation</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the Implementation stage is to make a new system operational. This is achieved through the transfer of the tested software modules to the <strong>live</strong> environment, along with setting up of the data required for the new system.</p>
    <h2>Planning for Implementation</h2>
    <p>Planning for implementation should happen as early as possible. Consider must be given to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>when the implementation will take place</li>
      <li>how you will determine if the implementation was successful</li>
      <li>what training users will need</li>
      <li>what documentation will be required</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Roles</h2>

    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>There are 4 different ways to deploy software.</p>
    <h3>Direct Changeover (Big Bang)</h3>
    <p>This approach is relevant to the Waterfall methodology where each stage of the SDLC is fully completed and signed off and finally the software is deployed live.</p>

    <h3>Phased implementation (Feature releases)</h3>
    <p>This approach is relevant to the Agile methodology where each sprint delivers a release of software.</p>
    <p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Introduce complexity gradually</td>
          <td>Users may not like new features being regularly introduced</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Users can learn at a steady pace</td>
          <td>Users may not use new features sticking to original limited work flows</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Can fall back to previous version (without new feature) if there are problems</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <h2>Traceability matrix</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cm-cSW66Isc" width="776" height="467" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>A traceability matrix keeps track of the relationship between a requirement and its artefacts (test, code, deployment, version). This way features can be tracked across teams, throughout the SDLC.</p>
    <h2>Semantic Versioning (Semver)</h2>
    <p>Semantic Versioning (Semver) is a naming convention for versioning software. It is made of three components:</p>
    <p><code>Major.Minor.Patch</code></p>
    <p>e.g. <code>10.13.6</code></p>
    <p><code>10</code> is the Major version<br><code>13</code> is the Minor version<br><code>6</code> is the patch number</p>
    <p>The Major version is incremented if you make breaking changes.</p>
    <p>The minor version is incremented with new features but no breaking changes.</p>
    <p>The patch number is incremented with bug fixes and improvements.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK</em> - Checkout what the semantic version of your iOS or Android operating system is.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Different phases of release</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="https://i0.wp.com/psyongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AlphaBeta_ReleaseCore.png?w=1184&#x26;ssl=1" alt="alpha beta 1.0">
    </p>
    <p>From the drawing above you can see the purpose of the different phases of release. An Alpha release to a small number of users, often testers, the essential first pass at the core of the application. Beta release opens to a wider user base, the application is not quite ready for complete release. Release in semver would be 1.0.0.</p>
    <h2>Output of the Implementation stage</h2>
    <p>The output of the Implementation stage is operational software.</p>
