    <h1>Mod 1 > Week 2 > Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we look at the Implementation (Deployment) stage of the SDLC.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the activities undertaken during release and deployment of an IT service, including implementation planning; training users and operations; user documentation; build software release; deploy software.</li>
      <li>Explain how configuration management techniques are used to control and manage the different software development artefacts through the stages of the SDLC and into live operation.</li>
      <li>Explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of 'phased deployment' versus 'big bang' deployment of software.</li>
      <li>Relate phased deployment and big bang deployment to waterfall and agile methods of development.</li>
      <li>Explain the role of software developers in 'early life support' for operational software.</li>
      <li>Explain the concepts of 'release packages'; alpha and beta releases; major and minor releases; software upgrades.</li>
      <li>Produce an appropriate version numbering system for software releases in a given case.</li>
      <li>Explain the concept of software licensing, and describe the types of licence that can be deployed, including proprietary licence; end-user licence; enterprise licence; site licence; workstation licence; perpetual licence; open-source licence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h2>Inputs to the Implementation stage</h2>
    <p>The input to this phase is tested software.</p>
    <h2>Purpose of Implementation</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the Implementation stage is to make a new system operational. This is achieved through the transfer of the tested software modules to the <strong>live</strong> environment, along with setting up of the data required for the new system.</p>
    <p>It is critical that earlier stages of the SDLC have included rigorous configuration management (version control) of software components so that it is clear exactly what bug fixes, features and improvements the final 'release package' contains.</p>
    <h2>Planning for Implementation</h2>
    <p>Planning for implementation should happen as early as possible. Consider must be given to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>when the implementation will take place</li>
      <li>how data will be migrated (often done via an <em>Extract-Transform-Load</em> (<em>ETL</em>) process where data is <em>extracted</em> from the old system, <em>transformed</em> into a format suitable for the new system and <em>loaded</em> into the new system)</li>
      <li>what hardware / infrastructure upgrades will be required</li>
      <li>what training users will need</li>
      <li>what documentation will be required</li>
      <li>who will be 'on call' to support the release</li>
      <li>how you will determine if the implementation was successful</li>
      <li>what happens if it all goes wrong</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Roles</h2>

    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>There are 4 different ways to deploy software.</p>
    <h3>Direct Changeover (Big Bang)</h3>
    <p>This approach is relevant to the Waterfall methodology where each stage of the SDLC is fully completed and signed off and finally the software is deployed live.</p>

    <h3>Phased implementation (Feature releases)</h3>
    <p>This approach is relevant to the Agile methodology where each sprint delivers a release of software.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79762578-d5592900-831a-11ea-9217-76259c1d1411.png" alt="feature releases">

      </thead>
      <tbody>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Introduce complexity gradually</td>
          <td>Users may not like new features being regularly introduced</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Users can learn at a steady pace</td>
          <td>Users may not use new features sticking to original limited work flows</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Can fall back to previous version (without new feature) if there are problems</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Traceability matrix</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cm-cSW66Isc" width="776" height="467" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>A traceability matrix keeps track of the relationship between a requirement and its artefacts (test, code, deployment, version). This way features can be tracked across teams, throughout the SDLC.</p>
    <h2>Semantic Versioning (Semver)</h2>
    <p>Semantic Versioning (Semver) is a naming convention for versioning software. It is made of three components:</p>
    <p><code>Major.Minor.Patch</code></p>
    <p>e.g. <code>10.13.6</code></p>
    <p><code>10</code> is the Major version<br><code>13</code> is the Minor version<br><code>6</code> is the patch number</p>
    <p>The Major version is incremented if you make breaking changes.</p>
    <p>The Minor version is incremented with new features but no breaking changes.</p>
    <p>The Patch number is incremented with bug fixes and improvements.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK</em> - Checkout what the semantic version of your iOS or Android operating system is.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK</em> - study the versioning strategy for software you use at work such as VSCode, IntelliJ, JUnit.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Different phases of release</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><em>Alpha</em> release</p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/142578393-a03e877e-f755-4caa-aee8-91b5bf7638ee.PNG" alt="GitHub Co-pilot alpha release testing invitation">
        </p>
        <p>An Alpha release is the first release of an application. It may not yet be fully feature complete or fully tested and is released to a small group of individuals, typically internal users or users willing to provide feedback for improvements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Beta</em> release</p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/142579722-d4e2e1ef-5c94-44a4-a2c0-0d159b437e37.PNG" alt="Beta test You Tube">
        </p>
        <p>A Beta release happens after an Alpha release. It will be feature complete and well tested however will be made available to a wider user base with the proviso that there may still be bugs in the software.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Software licensing</h2>
    <p>A software license is a legal contract governing how software is used or distributed. There are many different types of software license including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>proprietary licence</li>
      <li>end-user licence</li>
      <li>enterprise licence</li>
      <li>site licence</li>
      <li>workstation licence</li>
      <li>perpetual licence</li>
      <li>open-source licence</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>TASK</em> - find out the difference between each type of license and try to find an example of a software product which uses each license type</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Output of the Implementation stage</h2>
    <p>The output of the Implementation stage is operational software.</p>
