    <h1>Mod 3 > Week 2 > Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>The maintenance phase is your deployed software being cared for and improved. This phase ensures that software and services are accessible to users. This is the phase where the initial business needs that caused the software development life cycle to start turning are realised (or not).</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - Maintenance</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the activities that take place in the maintenance stage, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Minor enhancement;</li>
          <li>Major enhancement;</li>
          <li>Error correction;</li>
          <li>Temporary workaround / bug fix;</li>
          <li>Performance improvement;</li>
          <li>Routine updates and upgrades;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain the reasons and drivers for changes to software including changed user
        requirement; problem or incident identified; regulatory or other mandatory change;
        infrastructure / platform change.
      </li>
      <li>Describe the purpose of a service level agreement for operational software.</li>
      <li>
        Describe in outline a typical process for reporting, logging, and dealing with
        incidents and problems in operational software, and explain the terms ‚Äòfirst-line
        support‚Äô and ‚Äòsecond-line support‚Äô in this context.
      </li>
      <li>
        Describe at a high-level problem-solving techniques, including brainstorming; fault
        tree analysis; Kepner-Tregoe root cause analysis; Ishakawa diagrams (fishbone
        diagrams); decomposition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain the importance of managing and controlling changes to operational
        software.
      </li>
      <li>Describe in outline a typical process for the control of changes to live software.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>What now? We have live software in production that is addressing a business need. If only that were it. But things change:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New user requirements</li>
      <li>Market forces</li>
      <li>Problems, bugs, incidents</li>
      <li>Regulatory changes</li>
      <li>Platform changes</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Inputs</h1>
    <p>The input to the maintenance phase is production software. This phase mainly deals with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Major enhancements</li>
      <li>Minor enhancements</li>
      <li>Error corrections</li>
      <li>Bug fixes</li>
      <li>Performance improvements</li>
      <li>Routine updates and upgrades</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1st, 2nd, 3rd line support</h2>
    <p>One aspect of this phase of the SDLC is support. This can take the form of either 1st, 2nd or 3rd line support. Often this kind of support is managed by a system. Let us have a look at how it works.</p>
    <h3>1st line support</h3>
    <p>Usually a first point of contact when a bug or error is detected. This might be over the phone for example. Often this involves raising a ticket on a system so that your reported incident can be tracked. There may be quick solutions offered for example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‚Äúhave you tried turning it off and on again?‚Äù</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>2nd line support</h3>
    <p>This is usually more involved and often a support professional with domain knowledge will try to solve the problem. This typically involves on-site visits or remote sessions. 2nd line support technicians might escalate a something they are unable to fix to 3rd line support.</p>
    <h3>3rd line support</h3>
    <p>This level involves the experts. These are the people who actually wrote the software or the network engineers who actually installed a network.</p>
    <h1>When things go wrong</h1>
    <p>It happens. Sometimes software breaks in production.</p>

    <p>Bad. However RBS was able to find what caused the problem. In the following section we are going to learn about 4 different kinds of structured problem solving techniques.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brainstorming</li>
      <li>Fault tree analysis</li>
      <li>Ishakawa (fishbone) diagrams</li>
      <li>Kepner-Tregoe ‚ÄúRoot cause analysis‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/80510926-4e87fa00-8973-11ea-8aca-7d5911bd402e.png" alt="brainstorming">
    </p>
    <p>This is the more informal kind of problem solving and often a starting point. Members of the team pile in ideas as to what have caused a failure. There is no particular structure or order. A collection of possibilities is an easy first step a can then help a team decide what to focus on next.</p>
    <h2>Fault tree analysis</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/80510929-50ea5400-8973-11ea-9be6-3525b691e373.png" alt="fault tree analysis">
    </p>
    <p>Fault tree analysis is a top-down approach to identify all potential causes leading to a defect. Each cause is further broken down into least possible events or faults. The analysis begins with a major defect. All the potential events ‚Äì individual or in combination ‚Äì that may cause the defect are identified. Potential events are further traced down in a similar way to the lowest possible level.</p>
    <h2>Ishakawa (fishbone) diagrams</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/80510935-534cae00-8973-11ea-9843-db6da42e890b.png" alt="Ishakawa (fishbone) diagrams">

    <p>How to make your own:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Agree on a problem statement (effect). Write it at the center right of the flipchart or whiteboard. Draw a box around it and draw a horizontal arrow running to it.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm the major categories of causes of the problem. If this is difficult use generic headings:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <li>Machines (equipment)</li>
      <li>People (manpower)</li>
      <li>Materials</li>
      <li>Measurement</li>
      <li>Environment</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Write the categories of causes as branches from the main arrow.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm all the possible causes of the problem. Ask ‚ÄúWhy does this happen?‚Äù As each idea is given, the facilitator writes it as a branch from the appropriate category. Causes can be written in several places if they relate to several categories.</li>
      <li>Again ask ‚ÄúWhy does this happen?‚Äù about each cause. Write sub-causes branching off the causes. Continue to ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù and generate deeper levels of causes. Layers of branches indicate causal relationships.</li>
      <li>When the group runs out of ideas, focus attention to places on the chart where ideas are few.</li>
    </ol>
