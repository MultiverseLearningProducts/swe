    <h1>Mod 3 > Week 2 > Day 3</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we look at the primary differences between the Waterfall and Agile software development methodologies.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognise that there are a number of different methodologies used for software development that can broadly be categorised as sequential or iterative / incremental, and that some of these are Waterfall or Agile methods.</li>
      <li>Describe the main attributes and features of Waterfall software development methods.</li>
      <li>Describe the main attributes and features of Agile software development.</li>
      <li>Identify the main points of the Agile Manifesto:
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
          <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
          <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
          <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Describe the primary similarities and differences between Waterfall and Agile software development methods.</li>
      <li>List and describe in outline different agile software development methodologies, including Scrum; Kanban; Extreme Programming (XP); Test Driven Development (TDD).</li>
      <li>List and describe in outline different software development methods and approaches including <a href="https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/">Unified Process (UP)</a>; V-model; Spiral; Lean; DevOps.</li>
      <li>Recognise that business, market and information needs may lead to the development of very different software, whilst using similar software development methodologies.</li>
      <li>
        Explain the different business and market contexts that lead to different
        approaches to software development, including:
        Characteristics of market sectors and segments; Business drivers and desired outcomes; Market risk; Operational risk; Legal and regulatory requirements
      </li>
      <li>Distinguish advantages and disadvantages of using either waterfall or agile software development methods based on the factors listed above in a given scenario.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lean software development</h2>
    <p>Lean has its roots in manufacturing and is a set of techniques for cutting waste and doing things 'just in time'.</p>
    <p>Let's consider things which waste time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>documentation that is never read</li>
      <li>a feature that is very rarely used</li>
      <li>waiting for approvals</li>
      <li>fixing defects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lean software development aims to remove unnecessary work whilst delivering fast and to a high quality.</p>

    <h2>Sequential software development methodologies</h2>
    <h3>Waterfall methodology</h3>
    <p>The Waterfall methodology uses a sequential approach to software development. Each stage of the SDLC is completed and signed off before the next stage commences.</p>

    <h3>V-model</h3>
    <p>The V-model extends the Waterfall model by focussing on the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. Test artefacts are produced during requirements analysis (for user acceptance and system testing) and design (for integration and unit testing).</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>Iterative software development methodologies</h2>
    <p>The timeline below shows how early iterative software development methodologies evolved into Agile.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Spiral</h3>
    <p>The Spiral model is an risk-driven, iterative development process.</p>
    <p>The Spiral model has four phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Determine objectives</em></li>
      <li><em>Identify and resolve risks</em></li>
      <li><em>Develop and test</em></li>
      <li><em>Plan the next iteration</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations named 'Spirals'.</p>

    <h3>Unified Process (UP) / Rational Unified Process (RUP)</h3>
    <p>The Unified Process (sometimes known as the <em>Rational</em> Unified Process) is an iterative development methodology where development is organised in short, timeboxed iterations enabling adaptation to accommodate change. It is UML model (Use Case) driven.</p>
    <p>Each iteration consists of the following 4 phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Inception</em> - development of the Business Case, Project Plan and high level Use Cases</li>
      <li><em>Elaboration</em> - functional and non-functional requirements analysis, detailed risk analysis, development of the software architecture</li>
      <li><em>Construction</em> - the system is built and tested</li>
      <li><em>Transition</em> - the system is deployed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agile methodologies</h2>
    <h3>The Agile manifesto</h3>
    <p>The four core values of Agile software development as stated by the Agile Manifesto are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>we value individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
      <li>we value working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
      <li>we value customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
      <li>we value responding to change over following a plan</li>
    </ul>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gf7pBZxOCtY" width="776" height="467" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <h3>Scrum</h3>
    <p>Scrum proposes just 3 roles in the Agile process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Product owner</em> - represents the customer/project sponsor</li>
      <li><em>Development team</em> - the individuals who deliver the software</li>
      <li><em>Scrum master</em> - the person responsible for removing blockers tio allow the team to deliver the goals of the sprint</li>
    </ul>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pbqaxx7C7pE" width="776" height="467" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <h3>Kanban</h3>
    <p>'Kanban' is made up of two Japanese words, 'kan' which means <em>sign</em> and 'ban' which means <em>board</em>.</p>
    <p>Teams use a Kanban board to visualize the status of their tasks. Popular Kanban boards include, Trello and Jira.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/142780474-1d9e429f-3800-4d3b-aa96-290e1853ef85.PNG" alt="Example Kanban board">
    </p>
    <h3>Extreme Programming (XP)</h3>
    <p>XP is a lightweight methodology focussed on the coding activity in the SDLC. It describes a better way to programme that takes the pressure off developers and results in higher quality software.</p>
    <p>There are 4 key values in XP:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Communication</em></li>
      <li><em>Simplicity</em></li>
      <li><em>Feedback</em></li>
      <li><em>Courage</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example XP practices include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Producing all software in pairs (pair-programming)</li>
      <li>Writing tests before code</li>
      <li>Integrating and testing the system several times a day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h3>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
    <p>Test driven development describes a methodology where tests are written before the code is written.</p>
    <h2>DevOps</h2>
    <p>
      The term DevOps combines the terms 'Developers' and 'Operations'.
      DevOps focusses on the collaboration between developers and the operations team across the whole service lifecycle with the aim of rapid delivery of high-quality, robust software.
    </p>
    <p>DevOps relies heavily on automation (CI/CD).</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>You will be tasked to complete a Code Wars Kata using the XP technique of pair programming. Once the Kata is complete, discuss how you felt about working with someone else, was the Kata faster to solve? Did it take some pressure off? Did you enjoy it?</p>
    <p>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Waterfall and Agile methodologies and what kinds of projects each one is suitable for.</p>
    <p>Discuss the similarities between Agile and Waterfall methodologies.</p>
