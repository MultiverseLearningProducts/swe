    <h1>Mod 2 > Week 2 > Day 5</h1>
    <h1>Overview of the day</h1>
    <p>Below is information on how to book the exam as well, what to expect on the day and the retake policy.</p>
    <h2>How to book the exam</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you feel you are entitled to reasonable adjustments such as extra time, contact your coach who will explain how to apply for this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To schedule your exam, go <a href="https://examregistration.microsoft.com/?action=1&#x26;locale=en-us&#x26;examcode=98-382&#x26;examname=Introduction%20to%20Programming%20Using%20JavaScript&#x26;returnToLearningUrl=https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/98-382">here</a>. Note - if you have been given reasonable adjustments you will be used to book via the phone instead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You'll need a voucher code, which your coach will give to you</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Decide whether to book at a test centre or <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/microsoft/onvue">online</a>. Note the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/microsoft/onvue">system requirements and rules</a> for online tests.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What to expect on the day</h2>
    <p>You will have 45 minutes to complete 39 multiple choice questions. The pass mark is 70%.</p>
    <p>You must have 2 forms of ID ready to display before the test starts. The first name and last name MUST match the name on the registration form you used to book the exam online.</p>
    <p>Some questions are quite wordy so, DON'T PANIC, if you are unsure, mark that question as "Mark for Review" and move on. You can then go back to complete the "Mark for Review" questions.</p>
    <p>Some questions require you to drag code blocks into the correct order.</p>
    <p>The remaining time will be displayed as you work through the exam.</p>
    <p>If you are taking the test at a test center you will not be allowed to bring in personal belongings/phones/watches etc. (these will be kept securely for you). You should be allowed to bring in a (clear) water bottle. If you are driving to a test centre you may need to pay for parking at the site.</p>
    <p>If you have any issues on the day, e.g. you can't make it because your internet is down, call Pearson Vue on 0800 731 99 05</p>
    <h2>Retake policy</h2>
    <p>Here's Microsoft's retake policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If a candidate does not achieve a passing score on an exam the first time, the candidate must wait 24 hours before retaking the exam. At that time, candidates can log onto their certification dashboard and reschedule the exam themselves.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If a candidate does not achieve a passing score the second time, the candidate must wait at least 14 days before retaking the exam a third time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A 14-day waiting period is also imposed between the third and fourth attempts and fourth and fifth attempts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A candidate may not take a given exam any more than five times per year (12 months). This 12-month period starts from the first attempt. The candidate is eligible to retake the exam 12 months from the date of their first attempt.</p>
