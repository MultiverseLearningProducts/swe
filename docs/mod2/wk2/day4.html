    <h1>Mod 2 > Week 2 > Day 4</h1>
    <h1>Overview of the day</h1>
    <p>This is your time to revise the material we've covered and/or review anything else in the exam specification that you feel you need to. The notes below also prepare you for the test centre or online Pearson VUE experience so read them carefully.</p>
    <h2>Using a test centre or online Pearson VUE</h2>
    <p>Navigate to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/98-382">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/98-382</a> and navigate to "Schedule with Pearson VUE". Login with your Microsoft account and click "Continue" and "Schedule Exam". Select either "At a Test Centre" or "OnVUE" and <strong>read the preparation notes / watch the videos carefully</strong>.</p>
    <p>You must have 2 forms of ID ready to display before the test starts. The first name and last name MUST match the name on the registration form you used to book the exam online.</p>
    <p>If you are taking the test at a test center you will not be allowed to bring in personal belongings/phones/watches etc. (these will be kept securely for you). You should be allowed to bring in a (clear) water bottle. If you are driving to a test centre you may need to pay for parking at the site.</p>
    <p>If you have any issues on the day, e.g. you can't make it because your Internet is down, call Pearson Vue on 0800 731 99 05</p>
    <h2>Exam format</h2>
    <p>You will have 45 minutes to complete 39 multiple choice questions. The pass mark is 70%.</p>
    <p>Some questions are quite wordy so, DON'T PANIC, if you are unsure, mark that question as "Mark for Review" and move on. You can then go back to complete the "Mark for Review" questions.</p>
    <p>Some questions require you to drag code blocks into the correct order.</p>
    <p>You should be given paper and a pen for workings out if you are in a test centre. Online users have a <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/op/online-proctored-whiteboard-overview">note taking whiteboard feature</a>.</p>
    <p>The remaining time will be displayed as you work through the exam.</p>
    <p>On completion of the exam, whilst your score is being processed, you may review the questions again. Although you can't change any answers at this point it's very useful to take the time to calmly read the questions again should you need to re-take.</p>
