    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 4 > Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we are turning our attention to the Browser. Modern web applications are powered by javascript. There are lots of popular javascript frameworks like; React, Angular, Vue and others that help to organise and support building applications in a browser.</p>
    <p>We are going to look at a micro-framework call <a href="https://apprun.js.org/">AppRun</a>. I have selected this framework because of the design pattern it implements. It mimics the design of React, Elm and to some degree Vue and Angular. Learn this pattern of event driven programming and you'll feel at home as you pick up React or Elm.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 1 - The Event Object</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>understand how the <code>event</code> object is 'injected' into event handlers</li>
      <li>add event listeners to HTML elements</li>
      <li>create event handlers in javascript and attach them to event listeners</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You will need a new empty project</li>
      <li>Create a index.html, style.css and main.js</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You just need your html file and a browser</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>First of all how can you run javascript in the browser? There are 2 main ways:</p>
    <h3>Inline javascript</h3>
    <p>You can write javascript in an HTML file. You enclose your javascript in a <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag. As the page loads in the browser the HTML file is read from top to bottom, and any javascript in a <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag is executed when the page loads.</p>
    <p>Often times there is javascript included like this, for example the Google analytics function is often included inline in an HTML file.</p>
    <h3>Loaded from a source</h3>
    <p>You can load javascript from one or more files. When your javascript file has been loaded by the page, it will be executed. The way to include javascript that is loaded from an external file is to use the <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag and include the <code>src</code> HTML attribute with a URL as it's value. For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;script src="/main.js">&#x3C;/script>
</code></pre>
    <p>The line above will load and execute our <code>main.js</code> file. The final consideration for now is where and when our javascript is loaded.</p>
    <h4>üêò Remember HTML files are read from the top down</h4>
    <p>If we have libraries, modules or 3rd party javascript that we want to load these usually go in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> tag of the HTML page. Javascript that targets HTML elements (usually our app code) should be the final thing on the page to be included. In practice that means your app code should be included in a <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag just before the closing <code>&#x3C;/body></code> tag. Often app code will target an HTML element, and if that element has not been loaded our javascript will Error and Fail üòü.</p>
    <h4>module.exports and require</h4>
    <p>You can't use the file system in the browser. Things like <code>module.exports</code> and <code>require</code> are part of Node.js. We can load multiple <code>.js</code> files on our page, that is one way to breakup our code and make it easier to work with. However, you must be aware that each separate file is a separate round trip to the server, and you can't guarantee the order the files will be returned to you. You should be aware that each file that loads shared the Global scope of the window object; for example a class defined in one file, will be available for another file to access once they are both loaded on the page.</p>
    <h4>Browserify</h4>
    <p>You can use <code>module.exports</code> and <code>require</code> if you add a 'build step' to your frontend javascript. There are a few 'bundlers'; Webpack, rollup, parcel and browserify are the main ones. These bundlers will take javascript you have written in multiple files and 'bundle' them (with any dependencies) into one single file that you can server to the client. There is other set up that works best with these build steps (like nodemon) you need to re-pack or re-bundle your javascript after each file change you make. Tools like watchify can help with this, rollup has this built into it. Its called 'hot reloading'.</p>
    <h3>The Event Object</h3>
    <p>Javascript's main primitive is the <code>Object</code>. Lets start to learn about javascript in the browser by understanding the Event object. We can target parts of the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) using javascript HTML attributes. For example lets create a simple HTML button that triggers a javascript <code>Event</code> object.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;button onclick="console.log(event)">Click me&#x3C;/button>
</code></pre>
    <p>What kind of <code>Event</code> is triggered? What else can you learn about the event that just happened? Where on earth does the <code>event</code> that we are console.logging come from anyway?</p>
    <p>The <code>event</code> object (and it must be named 'event' not 'evt', 'e' or anything else) is injected by the browser. The event object is injected into every event handler. We are using the HTML attribute <code>onclick</code> and the value is a string that is the javascript to run upon that event.</p>
    <p>We can also have a named function defined in our <code>main.js</code> file, and include that in the string of javascript that is run when the event is triggered.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function myButtonHasBeenClicked(event) {
    console.log(event)
}
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;button onclick="myButtonHasBeenClicked(event)">Click me&#x3C;/button>
</code></pre>
    <h3>Event Listeners &#x26; Event Handlers</h3>
    <p><code>onclick</code> is an 'event listener'. It listens for clicks. An event listener will have a companion called an 'event handler'. <code>myButtonHasBeenClicked</code> is an 'event handler'. There are other ways to attach event listeners to elements in the DOM. For example the code below is another way to do the same thing we are doing above, but just using javascript.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const button = document.getElementById('my-button')
button.addEventListener('click', myButtonHasBeenClicked)
</code></pre>
    <p>The button has an id of 'my-button' that enables me to target the HTML element. Then instead of adding the event listener inline, we add it to the instance of the element in javascript. I am calling <code>addEventListener</code> with 2 arguments, a string that is the name of the type of listener, and the second argument is the function to call (with the event object) to handle the event.</p>
    <p>You can remove an event listener:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">button.removeEventListener('click', myButtonHasBeenClicked)
</code></pre>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Developers use frameworks to help them organise their code. When lots of people work on a codebase having a pattern to follow makes it much easier for team members to join and add to the code. We are going to use a simple framework called AppRun. If you can use AppRun you will find learning React or Elm much easier.</p>
    <p>Before we look at the framework lets think about the design pattern that underpins React, Elm and AppRun.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664104-a2ab2300-0b3c-11eb-8afd-233463f0218d.png" alt="state view update pattern">
    </p>
    <p>Both Elm and Redux follow the same pattern. Your app has state (this is the data Model). You app renders a view of that state. The view can trigger updates to some or all of the state. That state update triggers a re-render and your view is redrawn to represent the new state. This kind of programming style is called 'event driven'. It is 'declarative' like a spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664166-3f6dc080-0b3d-11eb-9885-a55e42acf475.gif" alt="example of a spreadsheet updating">
    </p>
    <p>You know how a spreadsheet works. Once your spreadsheet is all setup (or 'declared') if you change a value in one cell it can trigger updates to other cells that depend on that value. AppRun works like this.</p>
    <h3>Load AppRun</h3>
    <p>Load the AppRun library in a <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag from <code>unpkg.com</code> see below. You need an HTML element into which your app will be added. Your HTML page can be as simple as this. That is all the HTML we'll be writing in this file. Make yourself a <code>main.js</code> file for your javascript, and a stylesheet too if you want to make your app not look really offensive and brutal.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>
&#x3C;html>
    &#x3C;head>
        &#x3C;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
        &#x3C;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        &#x3C;script src="https://unpkg.com/apprun/dist/apprun-html.js">&#x3C;/script>
    &#x3C;/head>
    &#x3C;body>
        &#x3C;main id="app">&#x3C;/main>
        &#x3C;script src="main.js">&#x3C;/script>
    &#x3C;/body>
&#x3C;/html>
</code></pre>
    <h3>State</h3>
    <p>State in AppRun is (funnily enough) a plain javascript object. ALL the data in our app belongs here. We are going to make a quick todo list app, that will help us understand how to use AppRun. Our state is going to be a simple object which holds all our tasks.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const state = {
    tasks: []
}
</code></pre>
    <h3>View</h3>
    <p>To display the tasks we need a <code>view</code> function. This function will receive the <code>state</code> object and should return a string of HTML. We are going to write HTML in our javascript file. This is like the templating we did with Handlebars, only its just javascript string interpolation. We need a list and a form (like every app you are likely to ever work on).</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const view = state => `
    &#x3C;section>
        &#x3C;h2>Tasks&#x3C;/h2>
        &#x3C;ul>
            ${state.tasks.map(task => `&#x3C;li>${task.text}&#x3C;/li>`).join("")}
        &#x3C;/ul>
    &#x3C;section>
    &#x3C;section>
        &#x3C;form>
            &#x3C;input name="text" placeholder="Add a task" />
            &#x3C;button>Add&#x3C;/button>
        &#x3C;/form>
    &#x3C;/section>
`
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664952-e6edf180-0b43-11eb-9fc1-8cbda429b42d.png" alt="empty tasks">
    </p>
    <p>Remember the view function is just javascript so you can add branching logic, iteration, calculation and do other stunts, just end up with a string of valid HTML that will get added to your root HTML node, for us that is our <code>&#x3C;main id="app"></code> element.</p>
    <h3>Update</h3>
    <p>We want to be able to add a task. This requires us to capture the form submission, get the form data, create a task and add that into the state. Our update object will be the ONLY thing that interacts with the state. This is the most tricky part of AppRun to understand.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const update = {
    add: (state, form) => {
        const data = new FormData(form)
        const task = {
            id: window.crypto.getRandomNumber(new Uint8Array(2)).join("")
            text: data.get('text'),
            status: 0
        }
        state.tasks.push(task)
        return state
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>What is going on here? We have a javascript object. The properties are the names of update functions. In the example above we have defined the 'add' update function. Every update function will receive the state as it's first argument. It is injected (like the event object). If we give our update function an argument, that will appear as the second argument. We pass in the form instance. Use <code>new FormData(form)</code> to de-serialize the form data, then create a new object that represents a task. I am generating a random id. You can play with <code>window.crypto.getRandomNumber(new Uint8Array(2))</code> in the browser console and see what it does. We then update the state, and finally as we must in each update function, we return the new version of the state.</p>
    <p>This update will trigger a re-render of our view function.</p>
    <h3>Event listeners</h3>
    <p>For this to work we need to add an event listener to our view, and add the update function as the event handler.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;section>
    &#x3C;form onsubmit="app.run('add', this); return false;">
        &#x3C;input name="text" placeholder="Add a task" />
        &#x3C;button>Add&#x3C;/button>
    &#x3C;/form>
&#x3C;/section>
</code></pre>
    <p>What event are we listening for? Notice we call <code>app.run('add', this);</code> <em>this</em> is the form. We return <code>false</code> as this will prevent the default behavior of the form submission reloading the page! Will all this declared we are ready to initiate our app. Add the following to your <code>main.js</code></p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.start('app', state, view, update)
</code></pre>
    <p>
