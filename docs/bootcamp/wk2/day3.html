    <h1>Week 2 > Day 3</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Today we are starting to use our SQL skills in our Node.js code. This is an important step where we start to connect our code to a database.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - SQLite3 Installation</h2>
    <p>SQLite3 is a lightweight SQL database. It is often used in embedded devices such as phones and games consoles.</p>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQpmJ3NMHXf3v-uh4nT3O0keOjivstLweqSi7ZUbhvdFI1M6o4b2cDSFKFdz5YfakbewFyNjIdbrmBI/embed" width="776" height="467" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Follow these instructions to install SQLite:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Create a new directory for this week's work. <code>cd</code> into it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>run <code>npm init</code> to create a new <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Execute <code>npm install sqlite3</code> in the directory where your <code>package.json</code> lives. If you get errors, try <code>npm install sqlite3@5.0.0</code> instead. If you still have errors, follow the instructions below (note these are Windows specific):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Right click on VSCode and 'run as Administrator'. Navigate to the directory where your <code>package.json</code> file is and run <code>npm install --global --production windows-build-tools@4.0.0</code>.</li>
          <li>Close VSCode and run it again (this time not as administrator i.e. just double click on the icon). Execute <code>npm install sqlite3@5.0.0</code> in the directory where your <code>package.json</code> lives.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To check your install is successful, paste this code into a file named <code>dbconnect.js</code>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

const db = new sqlite3.Database(':memory:', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      return console.error(err.message);
    }
    console.log('Connected to the in-memory SQlite database.');
  });
  
  // close the database connection
  db.close((err) => {
    if (err) {
      return console.error(err.message);
    }
    console.log('Close the database connection.');
  });
</code></pre>
    <p>run the file with <code>node dbconnect.js</code>. You should see the console logs appear. You have successfully connected to the sqlite in-memory database.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Using Node.js to run queries</h2>
    <p>You may find the following links useful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/connect/">How to connect to a database</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/insert/">How to insert data into a database</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-nodejs/query/">How to query data from a database</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is simplified example of how to create a table and insert some rows into the table.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

// use a persistent database named myDb.sqlite
const db = new sqlite3.Database('./restaurants.sqlite');

/**
 * Executes the SQL statements one at a time.
 * 
 * Note the use of try/finally to ensure resources get closed 
 * whether an error occurs or not
 * 
 */
try {
    db.serialize(function () { // serialize means execute one statement at a time

        // create the empty table with specific columns and column types
        db.run("CREATE TABLE Restaurant(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
                                        name TEXT, image TEXT");

        let stmt;

        // insert 2 rows
        try {
            stmt = db.prepare(`INSERT INTO Restaurants (id, name, link) VALUES 
                        (1, 'Bayroot', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Europe/England/Brighton/brighton-restaurants-hotel-du-vin-bistro.jpg')`);
            stmt.run();
        } finally {
            // release resources 
            stmt.finalize();
        }

        // select the rows and print them out
        db.each("SELECT * FROM Restaurants",
            function (err, rows) {  // this is a callback function
                console.log(rows);  // rows contains the matching rows
            }
        );
    });
} finally {
    db.close();
}
</code></pre>
    <p>This code uses a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_try_catch.asp">try/finally</a> block to ensure that the statement and database are closed regardless of whether an error occurs. This is best practice to avoid memory leaks.</p>
    <p>The code also makes use of <strong>Prepared Statements</strong> which are key for ensure your database applications are not vulnerable to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection">SQL injection attacks</a>.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3')
const db = new sqlite3.Database('./db.sqlite')
</code></pre>
    <p>In the above lines above we import the <code>sqlite3</code> package then on the next line we access a constructor on the <code>sqlite3</code> object and use the <code>new</code> keyword to instantiate a new instance of our database for our programme. We can pass some config to our <code>Database</code> constructor. We are passing in a relative path where the database file either already exists, or if it doesn't exist where we would like it to be created and with what name.</p>
    <p>This file/database will be written to disc, data we store here we can access even when our programme has stopped running. We are going to interact with our database using javascript. The challenge we can use to start working with a database in our Node.js programme is to load the data from our file of airports into our database.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use your SQL commands from the previous day to create your 3 Restaurant tables</li>
      <li>Insert at least 2 rows into each table</li>
      <li>Query data from the tables</li>
      <li>Modify the code to query for only the rows which match a specific condition. Hint: use the <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter out the data you need.</li>
      <li>Use a JOIN to query tables and print out the results</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lesson 3 - Visualising your database</h2>
    <p>There is an <code>sqlite</code> plugin for VSCode which allows you to visualise your database.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Install the <code>sqlite</code> plugin for VSCode as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the <code>Extensions</code> icon and choose <code>sqlite</code> by <code>alexcvzz</code></li>
      <li>Select <code>View-Command Palette</code> from the menu</li>
      <li>Type <code>SQLite: Open Database</code></li>
      <li>Your database from the previous exercise should appear, select this</li>
      <li>A <code>SQLITE EXPLORER</code> window should appear at the bottom of your VSCode Explorer view. Click on this and expand it until you see the table CUSTOMERS. Click on the play icon and voila, you should see a visual representation of your database.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lesson 4 - Loading JSON data into SQLite3 using Node.js</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>In this lesson you will learn how to load your restaurant tables with data from file using Node.js. You will use nested iteration to loop through the data and relate data using foreign keys.</p>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <p>If you are on a Mac you can run the <code>curl</code> command below to retrieve the restaurant file content and save it to a file. If you are on Windows, you can paste the URL below into a browser and select to save it locally into your project directory.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sh">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultiverseLearningProducts/restaurant-data/master/restaurants.json --output restaurants.json
</code></pre>
    <p>This is called "seed" data. The idea is to seed our database with a data set we can use later. Remember to include ids and foreign keys to relate your menus to the right restaurants.</p>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Have a look at an example of a Menu Item object in the JSON:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-json">            {
                "title": "Cold Mezza/Starters",
                "items": [
                    {
                        "name": "Houmous",
                        "price": 5.00
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Baba Ganoush (Moutabal) (v)",
                        "price": 5.70
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Stuffed Vine Leaves (Warak Enab)",
                        "price": 5.70
                    }
                ]
            }
</code></pre>
    <p>If you are not familiar with JSON syntax work through this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp">JSON tutorial</a>.</p>
    <p>Key points to note are that</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces {}</li>
      <li>JSON objects are written in key/value pairs</li>
      <li>JSON arrays are implemented with <code>[]</code> syntax</li>
      <li>Keys and values are separated by a colon</li>
      <li>Each key-value pair is separated by a comma</li>
      <li>Keys must be always be strings and values must be a valid JSON data type i.e. one of string, number, object, array, boolean or null</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To insert the data we need to iterate over our array of Restaurants, then each Menu in the Restaurant and then over each Menu Item in each Menu to form our SQL insert queries.</p>
    <p>This sounds daunting so let's break in down into steps. We'll only show a subset of the full code as you will need to complete it in your next assignment.</p>
    <h3>Step 1 - Reading JSON data from a file using Node.js</h3>
    <p>Reading from a file may take a long time hence it is performed asynchronously. Here is one version of a <code>load()</code> method which you can use, it makes use of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, you can also write this using Promises or Callbacks.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const fsp = require('fs').promises; // Node.js file system module with promises

async function load() {
    console.log('calling load');
    // wait for the restaurant data file to be read
    const buffer = await fsp.readFile('./restaurants.json');
    const restaurants = (JSON.parse(String(buffer)));
    return restaurants;
}
</code></pre>
    <h3>Step 2 - Load the JSON data into your tables using Node.js</h3>
    <p>Now you have the data loaded, we need to loop through the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multidimensional-array-in-javascript/">multi-dimensional array</a> and insert it into our 3 tables. JavaScript supports a number of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">different types of loop</a>.</p>
    <p>You will need to create Prepared Statements to do the database inserts, for example,</p>
    <pre><code class="language-SQL">db.prepare("INSERT INTO MENU_ITEMS (menu_id, name, price) VALUES (?,?,?)");
</code></pre>
    <p>All the "?" are placeholders for the different values that we will be inserting as we iterate over our array of data. When you call <code>db.run</code> the first argument is the string above, and the second argument is an array of all the values you want to store, the values get swapped with the "?", your values have to be in the same order as the fields.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure you have fully completed Day 2's assignments and you have the SQL to create your 3 tables, linked together by FOREIGN KEYs</li>
      <li>Create a js file (named <code>initialiseDB.js</code>) which contains the code to CREATE your tables, we want to keep this separate from the code which INSERTS the data.</li>
      <li>Create a js file (named <code>populateDB.js</code>) which contains the code to load the JSON data and INSERTS the rows.</li>
      <li>Write a function called <code>load()</code> which loads the JSON data as an array of arrays from a file into a variable (see above)</li>
      <li>Write code within <code>db.serialize</code> which uses a recursive function to load each Restaurant, Menu &#x26; MenuItem into the database</li>
      <li>Remember to use <code>try/catch/finally</code> blocks to handle errors and close both the statements and database.</li>
      <li>Write a unit test that verify your seed data has loaded into the in memory database ok.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OPTIONAL EXTENSION LESSON FOR STUDENTS WORKING ON THE AIRPORT PROJECTS FROM WEEK 1</h2>
    <p>This lesson is optional and is designed solely as an extension task for those students who complete the airport coding assignments from week 1 quickly and need a further challenge. All the content above from Lesson 5 is relevant and students should refer to it. The airport specific aspects are described below.</p>
    <h3>Airports seed data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultiverseLearningProducts/airports/master/airportsData.json">airports.json</a> file from week <em>you can run the following command to download the file into your project folder</em></li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-sh">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultiverseLearningProducts/airports/master/airportsData.json --output airports.json
</code></pre>
    <p>Have a look at an example of an airport object:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "icao": "KPAE",
  "iata": "PAE",
  "name": "Snohomish County (Paine Field) Airport",
  "city": "Everett",
  "state": "Washington",
  "country": "US",
  "elevation": 606,
  "lat": 47.90629959,
  "lon": -122.2819977,
  "tz": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
</code></pre>
    <p>What are the field names and types we will need to set up in our database? This is called the schema. Once you have figured out the schema, can you compose a query that will create the airports table if it does not exist? We will want to run this before we read the data out of our file.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS airports(id INTEGER PRIM...etc);
</code></pre>
    <p>Once you have your query ready how do we run it? You can use the <code>run</code> function see below.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">db.run('YOUR SQL QUERY;', function (error) {
    /* this callback function runs after Node.js has 
    run the query on sqlite3 database, and the database 
    has emitted an event saying it's finished. In this 
    callback function on the `this` context you can 
    access the id of the last record you inserted. 
    This will be useful later */
    const id = this.lastID
})
</code></pre>
    <p>Once our database is setup we are ready to go get the data into it. Can you read the data from your .json file into an array of javascript objects? Try this and console.log your array to your terminal. (or you can just use <code>require</code> to load the file see below).</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const airports = require('./airport.json')
</code></pre>
    <h4>Load each airport object into the database</h4>
    <p>To insert the data we need to iterate over our array of airports and use the airport object to form an SQL insert query.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "icao": "KPAE",
  "iata": "PAE",
  "name": "Snohomish County (Paine Field) Airport",
  "city": "Everett",
  "state": "Washington",
  "country": "US",
  "elevation": 606,
  "lat": 47.90629959,
  "lon": -122.2819977,
  "tz": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-SQL">INSERT INTO airports (icao, iata, name, city, state, country, elevation, lat, lon, tz) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?);
</code></pre>
    <p>All the "?" are placeholders for the different values that we will be inserting as we iterate over our array of airports. When you call <code>db.run</code> the first argument is the string above, and the second argument is an array of all the values you want to store, the values get swapped with the "?", your values have to be in the same order as the fields.</p>
    <h4>Async?</h4>
    <p>Maybe this seems easy. We have an array of airports, we just iterate over the array and call <code>db.run</code> on for each airport. The thing is; inserting into a database is an async function. If we just call <code>db.run</code> on every item in the array what do you think will happen to the "pending callbacks" stack? Also how do we know when all the airports have been inserted into the database?</p>
    <p>When we have a queue of async tasks we want to perform a recursive pattern is a better option that <code>Array.forEach</code>.</p>
    <h3>Write a failing test</h3>
    <p>Here's an example of a Jest test which uses the <code>beforeAll</code> method to initialise the database with our tables if they don't already exist. Note that this uses airport tables but the concept is the same. The idea of the failing test helps you think about what you are actually trying to build.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const load = require('./index')

describe('SQLite3', () => {
    beforeAll(done => {
        db.exec('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS airports(...);', done)
    })
    test('airports are loaded into the database', (done) => {
        load((db) => {
            db.all('SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 3;', (err, row) => {
                expect(row.length).toBe(3)
                expect(row[0].name).toBe('Shenyang Dongta Airport')
                db.get('SELECT COUNT(id) AS total FROM airports;', (err, count) => {
                    expect(count.total).toBe(28868)
                    done()
                })
            })
        })
    })
})
</code></pre>
    <h2>Assignment for Airports</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>write a <code>load</code> function that will take a callback and call it when all the airport data has been inserted into the database.</li>
      <li>export this load function from your file.</li>
      <li>write an <code>insert</code> function in your load.js file that will take; the airports array, the callback passed to <code>load</code>, the database instance <code>db</code>.</li>
      <li>your <code>load</code> function can assume the airports table has been created i.e. <code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS airports....</code> can be run in your test setup <code>beforeAll</code> function.</li>
      <li>once the table is ready call the <code>insert</code> function you created in your load.js file with the airports array, the callback passed to <code>load</code>, the database instance <code>db</code></li>
      <li>in your <code>insert</code> function check if the airports array is empty. If it is empty call the callback function with the <code>db</code> instance and return from the function.</li>
      <li>if the airport array is not empty, in your <code>insert</code> function call <code>.pop()</code> on the airport array to remove the last airport from the array, then insert that item into the database</li>
      <li>in the <code>db.run</code> callback call the <code>insert</code> function again with the same arguments (this is called recursion)</li>
      <li>check that your tests are passing ok</li>
    </ul>
