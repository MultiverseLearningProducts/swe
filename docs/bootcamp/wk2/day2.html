    <h1>Bootcamp > Week 2 > Day 2</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the day</h2>
    <p>Here is a class diagam representing a model for a restaurant ordering app.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/105141638-5d11d500-5af1-11eb-98ee-d177df9c5894.png" alt="restaurantClassDiagram">
    </p>
    <p>Imagine we write some code to create instances of these classes with real restaurant and menu data. The problem is all the data is lost when your app stops. The data that makes the app persists only in memory, so when the process dies, so does the data. Today is about fixing that.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 1 - SQL</h2>
    <p>A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) refers to a database that stores data using rows and columns. Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to query data in RDMSs.</p>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how to execute basic SQL statements</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Work through the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp">W3Schools SQL Tutorial</a> up to and including the 'SQL Delete' lesson. This tutorial will enable you to understand how to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data to / from a SQL database.</p>
    <p>Once you are comfortable with this syntax, move on to look at how to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp">create a table</a> &#x26; <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_drop_table.asp">drop a table</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Creating the Restaurant Tables</h2>
    <p>We will use a website called <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl</a> to practise our SQL syntax before we move on and incorporate the SQL into some Node.js code.</p>
    <p>Before we do that, you should be aware of the Data Types for SQLite:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Data type</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>NULL</td>
          <td>The value is a NULL value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>INTEGER</td>
          <td>The value is a signed integer</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>REAL</td>
          <td>The value is a floating point value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TEXT</td>
          <td>The value is a text string</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>BLOB</td>
          <td>The value is a blob of data</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>You should also be aware of 2 SQLite specific SQL statements which will help you.</p>
    <p>The <code>PRAGMA</code> command describes a table, including its columns and primary keys.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sql">PRAGMA table_info(CUSTOMERS);
</code></pre>
    <p>The following command lists all the tables in the database:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'
</code></pre>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>In this assignment you need to use SQL to create the tables which correspond to the Restaurant class diagram above.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign up for a Repl account</li>
      <li>Create a new repl and select <code>SQLite</code> as the language</li>
      <li>Compose the SQL queries to do the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Implement the Restaurants table - make the id of the restaurant the PRIMARY KEY (this has to be unique)</li>
          <li>Create an entry for a restaurant using "INSERT"</li>
          <li>Read back your restaurant using "SELECT"</li>
          <li>Update your restaurant using "UPDATE"</li>
          <li>Delete your restaurant using "DELETE"</li>
          <li>Use the WHERE clause to filter results</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Now compose the SQL queries to implement the Menu table and MenuItem tables and practise inserting and deleting rows (don't worry about the relationships for now)</li>
      <li>Share your repl with your coach on Slack</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Lesson 3 - JOIN tables</h2>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Execute SQL commands</li>
      <li>Relate data using foreign keys</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>It is great to be able to save a restaurant in our database. However our data model requires our restaurants to also have menu's associated with them. A restaurant might have many menus; for example a main menu, a set menu, a wine menu (wine list) and best of all the dessert menu! How can we store one or more menu items on the restaurant? We could make a new field on the restaurant table called 'menu'. But what would we do if we wanted to add a 2nd menu 'menu2'? And a third 'menu3'?</p>
    <p>No. The way this is done is by creating a separate table for the menus. When we create a row in the 'menus' table we create a special field to store the id of the restaurant we want the menu to be associated with. The convention is to call the field something like 'restaurant_id'. This is why databases that have tables like this are called 'relational databases'.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Modify your tables to include these relationships:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>add a <code>restaurant_id</code> column to the Menu table</li>
      <li>add a <code>menu_id</code> column to the MenuItem table</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How do we use the association we just created? When we query our database we are going to use the 'JOIN' keyword in SQL.</p>
    <p>Read about the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp">SQL Join command</a> to understand its syntax.</p>
    <p>Now read the query below:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT restaurants.name, menus.name 
FROM restaurants 
JOIN menus ON restaurants.id = menus.restaurant_id 
WHERE restaurants.id = 1;
</code></pre>
    <p>This statement selects the columns we want to retrieve from both tables; the restaurants table and the menus table. Notice now we have mixed fields coming from different tables, we have to name our columns with both the <code>table_name.field_name</code> i.e. <code>menus.name</code>. Use the <code>JOIN</code> keyword to make an association between the primary key from one table and the foreign key of another. In this example the primary key is the restaurants table id and the menus table restaurant_id. Can you explain why 'restaurant_id' is referred to as the foreign key?</p>
    <p>Write some JOIN statements that do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SELECT a restaurant, a menu and all the menu items using a JOIN statement</li>
      <li>SELECT all the restaurants with a count of the number of menus each restaurant has</li>
      <li>SELECT all the menus, with the total cost of all the menu items summed, and have the list in descending order (most expensive first)</li>
      <li>[extension activity] explore the documentation for SQL the <code>SUM</code>, <code>COUNT</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code> aggregate functions</li>
    </ul>
