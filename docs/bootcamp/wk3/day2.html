    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Our app has an array of restaurants that we want to display on our page. Handlebars enables us to iterate over an array of data and repeatedly add the same parsed html block to our final page. This is how dynamic lists of content are rendered. The example below can be seen all over the Internet and is a good example of a <em>card</em> component.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95015340-344df880-0644-11eb-8ce4-30609f0de5fe.jpg" alt="example of the card component">
    </p>
    <p>Can you recognise the template vs the dynamic content in the example above?</p>
    <h3>Passing the Restaurant data to the view template</h3>
    <p>Our first step is to prepare the data for the view template and the second step is to pass it to the view template. The example below uses sequelize to fetch all the restaurants and passes this to the <code>home.handlebars</code> layout template.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first argument to <code>response.render</code> is the matching string name of the layout file we want to render. In this example, the name 'restaurants' refers to a file named <code>home.handlebars</code>.</li>
      <li>The second argument to <code>response.render</code> is the Restaurant data returned from the sequelize query.</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurants = await Restaurant.findAll({
        include: [{model: Menu, as: 'menus'}],
        nest: true
    })
    res.render('home', {restaurants})
})
</code></pre>
    <p>To use <code>include</code> as in the code above, make sure your <strong>Restaurant</strong> class has the following aliases added. This config sets the name of the property our associated model will be stored on i.e. <code>restaurants.menus</code>.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">Restaurant.hasMany(Menu, {as: 'menus', foreignKey: 'restaurant_id'})
Menu.belongsTo(Restaurant, {foreignKey: 'restaurant_id'})
</code></pre>
    <p>Also ensure your Menu class has the correct aliases as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">Menu.hasMany(MenuItem, {as: 'items', foreignKey: 'menu_id'});
MenuItem.belongsTo(Menu, {foreignKey: 'menu_id'});
</code></pre>
    <p>You will be able to see the impact of the above in the SQL statements output when running the <code>server.js</code> file.</p>
    <p>In our view template there will be an object called 'restaurants' that will be the array of data that came from <code>await Restaurant.findAll()</code>. We can write our html elements as if this was an html file, only when we want to parse some dynamic content do can use handlebars to create placeholders. This is very much like 'mail merge' in word or other pieces of software you might have come across.</p>
    <p>To repeat a block of code for every item in an array we can use the built in template helper <code>{{#each}}</code> that comes with handlebars.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;h1>Restaurants&#x3C;/h1>
&#x3C;section>
    {{#each restaurants}}
        &#x3C;article>
            &#x3C;header>&#x3C;/header>
            &#x3C;main>{{this.name}}&#x3C;/main>
            &#x3C;footer>{{this.menus.length}} menus&#x3C;/footer>
        &#x3C;/article>
    {{/each}}
&#x3C;/section>
</code></pre>
    <p>From the code above where does the repeating block of html begin and end? Try this in your browser, when you inspect the html what do you expect to see?</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>(Optional) - watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbrqxPcuYVc">this video</a> about using the <code>each</code> Handlebars helper keyword</li>
      <li>Read through the previous section and make the required changes to your <code>server.js</code> file.</li>
      <li>Add the correct associations to the Menu and Restaurant classes</li>
      <li>Create a new view layout called <code>home.restaurants</code> and include HTML to loop through the array of Restaurants. The code should display as a minimum, the title of each restaurant.</li>
      <li>Challenge yourself to display the image associated with each restaurant.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>

    </ul>
    <h2>Materials needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>style.css file served from your public folder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>We have restaurants on the page! What we don't have is something attractive or pleasing. We need to give our html page some loving css rules to lay it out nicely. Designing for the web is quite unsual because the screen sizes for a web page are so dramatically different.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://d1xzrcop0305fv.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/zymr-adaptive-responsive-design_3.jpg" alt="different screen sizes for web pages">
    </p>
    <p>Where do we put things if we want our page to look good on both a mobile phone and a large 26" monitor? The anwser to this question was beautifully addressed by Ethan Marcotte back in 2010 an a blog he wrote called <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a>.</p>
    <h3>Responsive @media</h3>
    <p>CSS comes with a <code>@media</code> API which was orignialy added to the spec so you could style a printer friendly version of your page. The basic API of <code>@media</code> enables you to apply css to your page at particular screen sizes. The css is immediately applied so your page does not require a refresh for the new css rules to be visible once your screen size changes.</p>
    <p>This solved the problem of having to server different html templates and css to different devices.</p>
    <h3>Understanding the viewport</h3>
    <p>The <strong>viewport</strong> is the visible area of a web page.</p>
    <p>The viewport varies with the device e.g. the viewport on a mobile phone is smaller than on a computer screen.</p>
    <p>To make our page responsive (i.e. to look good on all devices) we need to gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.</p>
    <p>Add the following line to the <code>&#x3C;head></code> element of your html <code>main.handlebars</code> file.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&#x3C;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>width=device-width</code> part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).</p>
    <p>The <code>initial-scale=1.0</code> part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</p>
    <p>The impact of setting the viewport can be visualised <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Mobile first</h3>
    <p>The way to implement a responsive layout is start with the smallest screen size; the mobile. These layouts are often the most simple. As the screen size get larger you can start to make more use of the real estate that becomes available.</p>
    <p>Lets start. Empty your <code>style.css</code> and add the following css:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">* {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}

/* put css styling for  
   mobile devices here */

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  /* put css styling for mid-sized screens here */
}

@media screen and (min-width: 60em) {
  /* put css styling for massive screens here */
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Note that we are using <code>em</code> units here rather than <code>pixels</code>. This allows elements to scale if the root element changes (e.g. if a user changes their default font size, all elements on the page will scale appropriately).</p>
    <p>This css gives us two break points. at 40em and then at 60em. We remove any browser default padding or margin. Can you get your background color to change at the different break points? If you are unsure, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">this tutorial</a> may help.</p>
    <h3>Grid</h3>
    <p>Use the different device profiles that come with the chrome dev tools.</p>
    <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode"><img src="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/imgs/landscape.png" alt="chrome dev tools"></a></p>
    <p>Pick a mobile phone. Set the orientation to portrait. For small screens our content can just be in a single column, then our user scrolls through the restaurants. This is where we can start. We want a single resturant <em>card</em> to occupy the width of the screen. So lets just start with this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
    padding: 1rem;
    border-bottom: solid 1px black;
}
article {
    border: solid 1px black;
    width: calc(100% - 2rem);
    height: 35em;
    margin: 1rem 1rem;
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Now we have a card shape box in which we can display information about each restaurant (including it's 'thumbnail' image). They are spaced out evenly and we can scroll through them. I am also using <code>calc()</code> to calculate the width of the viewport minus the margins either side.</p>
    <p>What happens a the first breakpoint?</p>
    <p>Once our viewport size has broken through to be greater than <code>40em</code> the next block of css will override previous styles. We want to jump from a single column layout to a 2 column layout.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  /* css for mid screens goes here */
    section {
        margin: 1rem;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: auto auto;
        grid-template-rows: none;
        gap: 1rem;
    }
    article {
        margin: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>We now apply a grid layout to the <code>&#x3C;section></code> element. That grid is applied to the section's children elements (all the <code>&#x3C;article></code> elements). We don't know how many restaurants we'll have so we are not defining the rows in this case. We also adjust the width of the <code>&#x3C;article></code> elements and remove the margins, we pass this responsibility now to the parent 'grid' element. CSS 'grid' has a very handy <code>gap</code> property that will deal with spacing between grid elements. Finally we can use the margin of the <code>&#x3C;section></code> to add some spacing all round the items in the grid.</p>
    <p>The next break point we want to jump to 3 columns. Now we just need to override one property.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-css">@media screen and (min-width: 60em) {
  /* css for massive screens goes here */
    section {
        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>So we have covered responsive layouts using @media (media queries), and taken a quick look at the power of 'grid' in CSS.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you implement a responsive layout for your restaurant's app?</li>
