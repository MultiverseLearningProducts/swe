    <h1>Foundations</h1>
    <p>You are going to lay the foundations of your programming career by learning JavaScript as your first language.</p>
    <p>Learning javascript means you will be able to write programmes that run in a web browser, and on a server. By combining these two different environments you will have the power to build full stack applications.</p>
    <p>We'll learn by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paying close attention to our study materials and the code we write</li>
      <li>Being actively engaged with the material we work with</li>
      <li>Having effective error correction from our coach</li>
      <li>Consolidating our learning through practice and sleeping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The pattern for our foundation course is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Online independent study to learn syntax and concepts</li>
      <li>Coaching sessions to challenge our knowledge and direct our learning</li>
      <li>Practical exercises to consolidating our learning</li>
      <li>Teaching things we have learnt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/</a></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the course called: <strong>Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)</strong> - Complete the first course called: <strong>Basic Javascript</strong></li>
      <li>Contact your coach when you have completed this.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <h3>FizzBuzz</h3>
    <p>There is a party game called FizzBuzz. For every number that is divisible by 3 you have to say <em>fizz</em> instead of the number, for every number that is divisible by five you have to say <em>buzz</em> instead of the number, for every number that is both divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 you have to replace that number with the word <em>fizzbuzz</em>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>-1-2-fizz-4-buzz-fizz-7-8-fizz-buzz-11-fizz-13-14-fizzbuzz-...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>ðŸ”± Can you write a programme that will printout the numbers 1 - 100 and replace the right numbers with the right words?</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <h3>Array Structures</h3>
    <p>How do you:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>create an array?</li>
      <li>add items to an array?</li>
      <li>remove items from an array?</li>
      <li>Access items in an array?</li>
      <li>Can you place an array in an array?</li>
      <li>Can you make a grid structure 3 x 3?</li>
      <li>Can you put items in the grid structure?</li>
      <li>Can you reference items in the grid structure i.e. <em>array[2][1]</em></li>
    </ol>
    <p>ðŸ”± Can you create a grid 3x3 and then place counters <code>O</code> or <code>X</code> at places in the grid (like you were playing noughts and crosses)?</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <h3>Array Functions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>map over an array</li>
      <li>filter an array</li>
      <li>reduce an array</li>
    </ol>
